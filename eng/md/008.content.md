## Gentile (id: 26631)

Gentile
=======

Facts:
------

The term “Gentile” refers to anyone who is not a Jew. Gentiles are people who are not descendants of Jacob.

* In the Bible, the term “uncircumcised” is also used figuratively to refer to Gentiles because many of them did not circumcise their male children as the Israelites did.
* Because God chose the Jews to be his special people, they thought of the Gentiles as outsiders who could never be God’s people.
* The Jews were also called “Israelites” or “Hebrews” at different times in history. They referred to anyone else as a “Gentile.”
* Gentile could also be translated as “not a Jew” or “non\-Jewish” or “not an Israelite” (Old Testament) or “non\-Jew.”.
* Traditionally, Jews would neither eat with nor associate with Gentiles, which at first caused problems within the early church.

## Goat (id: 26645)

goat, goatskins, scapegoat, kids
================================

Definition:
-----------

A goat is a medium\-sized, four\-legged animal which is similar to a sheep and is raised primarily for its milk and meat. A baby goat is called a “kid.”

* Like sheep, goats were important animals of sacrifice, especially at Passover.
* Although goats and sheep can be very similar, these are some ways that they are different:

    + Goats have coarse hair; sheep have wool.
        + The tail of a goat stands up; the tail of a sheep hangs down.
        + Sheep usually like to stay with their herd, but goats are more independent and tend to wander away from their herd.
* In Bible times, goats were often the main source of milk in Israel.
* Goat skins were used for tent coverings and to make bags for holding wine.
* In both the Old and New Testaments, the goat was used as a symbol for unrighteous people, perhaps because of its tendency to wander away from the one taking care of it.
* The Israelites also used goats as symbolic sin bearers. When one goat was sacrificed, the priest would lay his hands on a second, live goat, and send it into the desert as a symbol that the animal was bearing the people’s sins.

## God (id: 26646)

God
===

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “God” refers to the eternal being who created the universe out of nothing. God exists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God’s personal name is “Yahweh.”

* God has always existed; he existed before anything else existed, and he will continue to exist forever.
* He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe.
* God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.
* He is a covenant\-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.
* People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship.
* God revealed his name as “Yahweh,” which means “he is” or “I am” or “the One who (always) exists.”
* The Bible also teaches about false “gods,” which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Ways to translate “God” could include “Deity” or “Creator” or “Supreme Being” or “Supreme Creator” or “Infinite Sovereign Lord” or “Eternal Supreme Being.”
* Consider how God is referred to in a local or national language. There may also already be a word for “God” in the language being translated. If so, it is important to make sure that this word fits the characteristics of the one true God as described above.
* Many languages capitalize the first letter of the word for the one true God, to distinguish it from the word for a false god. Another way to make this distinction would be to use different terms for “God” and “god.” NOTE: In the biblical text, when a person who does not worship Yahweh speaks about Yahweh and uses the word “god,” it is acceptable to render the term without a capital letter in reference to Yahweh (see Jonah 1:6, 3:9\).
* The phrase “I will be their God and they will be my people” could also be translated as “I, God, will rule over these people and they will worship me.”

## God the Father (id: 26648)

God the Father, heavenly Father, Father
=======================================

Facts:
------

The terms “God the Father” and “heavenly Father” refer to Yahweh, the one true God. Another term with the same meaning is “Father,” used most often when Jesus was referring to him.

* God exists as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Each one is fully God, and yet they are only one God. This is a mystery that mere humans cannot fully understand.
* God the Father sent God the Son (Jesus) into the world and he sends the Holy Spirit to his people.
* Anyone who believes in God the Son becomes a child of God the Father, and God the Holy Spirit comes to live in that person. This is another mystery that human beings cannot fully understand.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* In translating the phrase “God the Father,” it is best to translate “Father” with the same word that the language naturally uses to refer to a human father.
* The term “heavenly Father” could be translated by “Father who lives in heaven” or “Father God who lives in heaven” or “God our Father from heaven.”
* Usually “Father” is capitalized when it, refers to God.

Definition:
-----------

The term “godly” is used to describe a person who acts in a way that honors God and shows what God is like. “Godliness” is the character quality of honoring God by doing his will.

* The terms “godless” and “godlessness” literally mean that the people are “without God” or “having no thought of God” or “acting in a way that does not acknowledge God.”

## Gold (id: 26649)

gold, golden
============

Definition:
-----------

Gold is a yellow, high quality metal that was used for making jewelry and religious objects. It was the most valuable metal in ancient times.

* In Bible times, many different kinds of objects were made out of solid gold or were covered with a thin layer of gold.
* These objects included earrings and other jewelry, and idols, altars, and other objects used in the tabernacle or temple, such as the ark of the covenant.
* In Old Testament times, gold was used as a means of exchange in buying and selling. It was weighed on a scale to determine its value.
* Later on, gold and other metals such as silver were used to make coins to use in buying and selling
* When referring to something that is not solid gold, but only has a thin covering of gold, the term “golden” or “gold\-covered” or “gold\-overlaid” could also be used.
* Sometimes an object is described as “gold\-colored,” which means it has the yellow color of gold, but may not actually be made of gold.

govern, governor, proconsul, Tirshatha
======================================

Definition:
-----------

A “governor” is a person who rules over a large area of land (such as a territory, region, or province) within a nation or empire.

* In the Old Testament, the term “Tirshatha” is a more specific title for a governor who ruled over a Persian province.
* In the New Testament, the term “proconsul” is a more specific title for a governor who ruled over a Roman province.
* In Bible times, governors were appointed by a king or emperor and were under his authority.
* A “government” consists of all the rulers who govern a certain country or empire. These rulers make laws that guide the behavior of their citizens so that there is peace, safety, and prosperity for all the people of that nation.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The word “governor” can also be translated as “ruler” or “overseer” or “regional leader” or “one who rules over a small territory.”
* Depending on the context, the term “govern” could also be translated as “rule over” or “lead” or “manage” or “supervise.”
* The term “governor” should be translated differently than the terms for “king” or “emperor”, since a governor was a less powerful ruler who was under their authority.
* The term “proconsul” could also be translated as “Roman governor” or “Roman provincial ruler.”
