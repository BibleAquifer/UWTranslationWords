## Eagle (id: 26544)

eagle
=====

Definition:
-----------

An eagle is a very large, powerful bird of prey that eats small animals such as fish, mice, snakes, and chickens.

* The Bible compares the speed and strength of an army to how fast and suddenly an eagle swoops down to catch its prey.
* Isaiah states that those who trust in the Lord will soar as an eagle does. This is figurative language used to describe the freedom and strength that comes from trusting and obeying God.
* In the book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar’s hair length was compared to the length of an eagle’s feathers, which can be more than 50 centimeters long.

* During New Testament times, Edom covered the southern half of the province of Judea. The Greeks called it “Idumea.”

## Ekron (id: 26549)

Ekron, Ekronites
================

Facts:
------

Ekron was a major city of the Philistines, located nine miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea.

* A temple of the false god Baal\-zebub was located at Ekron.
* When the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, they took it to Ashdod and then moved it to Gath and Ekron because God kept causing people to get sick and die in whatever city the ark was taken to. Finally the Philistines sent the ark back to Israel.
* When King Ahaziah fell through the roof of his house and injured himself, he sinned by trying to find out from the false god Baal\-zebub of Ekron as to whether or not he would die from his injuries. Because of this sin, Yahweh said that he would die.

## Elder (id: 26551)

elder, older, old
=================

Definition:
-----------

The term “elder” or “older” refers to people (in the Bible, usually men) who have grown old enough to become mature adults and leaders within a community. For example, elders might have gray hair, have adult children, or perhaps even have grandchildren or great\-grandchildren.

* The term “elder” came from the fact that elders were originally older men who, because of their age and experience, had greater wisdom.
* In the Old Testament, the elders helped lead the Israelites in matters of justice and the Law of Moses.
* In the New Testament, Jewish “elders” continued to be leaders in their communities and also were judges for the people.
* In the early Christian churches, Christian “elders” gave spiritual leadership to the local assemblies of believers. Elders in these churches sometimes included young men who were spiritually mature.
* This term could be translated as “older men” or “spiritually mature men leading the church.”

## Elect (id: 26553)

chosen, choose, chosen people, Chosen One, elect
================================================

Definition:
-----------

The term “the elect” literally means “chosen ones” or “chosen people” and refers to those whom God has appointed or selected to be his people. “Chosen One” or “Chosen One of God” is a title that refers to Jesus, who is the chosen Messiah.

* The term “choose” means to select something or someone or to decide something. It is often used to refer to God appointing people to belong to him and to serve him.
* To be “chosen” means to be “selected” or “appointed” to be or do something.
* God chose people to be holy, to be set apart by him for the purpose of bearing good spiritual fruit. That is why they are called “the chosen (ones)” or “the elect.”
* The term “chosen one” is sometimes used in the Bible to refer to certain people such as Moses and King David whom God had appointed as leaders over his people. It is also used to refer to the nation of Israel as God’s chosen people.
* The phrase “the elect” is an older term that literally means “the chosen ones” or “the chosen people.” This phrase in the original language is plural when referring to believers in Christ.
* In older English Bible versions, the term “elect” is used in both the Old and New Testaments to translate the word for “chosen one(s).” More modern versions use “elect” only in the New Testament, to refer to people who have been saved by God through faith in Jesus. Elsewhere in the Bible text, they translate this word more literally as “chosen ones.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* It is best to translate “elect” with a word or phrase that means “chosen ones” or “chosen people.” This could also be translated as “people whom God chose” or “the ones God appointed to be his people.”
* The phrase “who were chosen” could also be translated as “who were appointed” or “who were selected” or “whom God chose.”
* “I chose you” could be translated as “I appointed you” or “I selected you.”
* In reference to Jesus, “Chosen One” could also be translated as “God’s chosen One” or “God’s specially appointed Messiah” or “the One God appointed (to save people).”

## Enslave (id: 26562)

enslave, slave, bondservant, bondage, bound, bonds, young man, young women
==========================================================================

Definition:
-----------

To “enslave” someone means to force that person to serve a master or a ruling country. To be “enslaved” or “in bondage” means to be under the control of something or someone. A “slave” refers to a person who works for (or obeys) another person, either by choice or by force. A slave was under the direction of their master. In the Bible, “servant” and “slave” are mostly interchangable terms.

* A person who is enslaved or in bondage must serve others without payment; he is not free to do what he wants. Another word for “bondage” is “slavery.”
* The New Testament speaks of human beings as “enslaved” to sin until Jesus frees them from its control and power. When a person receives new life in Christ, he stops being a slave to sin and becomes a slave to righteousness.
* In the Bible the words “young man” or “young woman” often mean “servant” or “slave.” This meaning will be discerned from context. One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” which could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “enslave” could be translated as “cause to not be free” or “force to serve” or “put under the control of.”
* The phrase “enslaved to” or “in bondage to” could be translated as “forced to be a slave of” or “forced to serve” or “put under the control of.”
* A slave was a kind of servant who was the property of the person he worked for. The person who bought a slave was called his “owner” or “master.” Some masters treated their slaves cruelly. Other masters treated their slaves well, like a valued member of the household. The term “slavery” means the state of being a slave.
* A person could be a slave temporarily, for instance while working to repay a debt to his owner.
