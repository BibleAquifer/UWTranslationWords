## Lamb (id: 26809)

lamb, Lamb of God
=================

Definition:
-----------

The term “lamb” refers to a young sheep. Sheep are four\-legged animals with thick, woolly hair, used for sacrifices to God. Jesus is called the “Lamb of God” because he was sacrificed to pay for people’s sins.

* These animals are easily led astray and need protecting. God compares human beings to sheep.
* God instructed his people to sacrifice physically perfect sheep and lambs to him.
* Jesus is called the “Lamb of God” who was sacrificed to pay for people’s sins. He was a perfect, unblemished sacrifice because he was completely without sin.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* If sheep are known in the language area, the name for their young should be used to translate the terms “lamb” and “Lamb of God.”
* “Lamb of God” could be translated as “God’s (sacrificial) Lamb,” or “Lamb sacrificed to God” or “(sacrificial) Lamb from God.”
* If sheep are not known, this term could be translated as “a young sheep” with a footnote that describes what sheep are like. The note could also compare sheep and lambs to an animal from that area that lives in herds, that is timid and defenseless, and that often wanders away.
* Also consider how this term is translated in a Bible translation of a nearby local or national language.

* The lampstand would be tall enough so that the light of the lamp could shine throughout the room.
* The lampstand could be made of wood or metal and could hold one or more lamps.
* Ordinary lamps were made of clay, and lamps for special purposes, such as for the temple, were made of metal (such as bronze, silver, or gold.)
* The lamps were in the shape of a bowl with a raised lip on one side that held a wick. The lamps were filled with olive oil that soaked the wick and burned when the wick was lighted.

## Law (id: 26815)

law, principle
==============

Definition:
-----------

A “law” is a legal rule that is usually written down and enforced by someone in authority. A “principle” is a guideline for decision\-making and behavior, and is usually not written down or enforced. However, sometimes the term “law” is used to mean a “principle.”

* A “law” is similar to a “decree,” but the term “law” is generally used to refer to something written rather than spoken.
* Both “law” and “principle” can refer to a general rule or belief that guides a person’s behavior.
* This meaning of “law” is different from its meaning in the term “law of Moses,” where it refers to commands and instructions that God gave the Israelites.
* When a general law is being referred to, “law” could be translated as “principle” or “general rule.”

Most simply, the term “law” refers to a rule or instruction that should be followed. In the Bible, the term “law” is often used generally to refer to anything and everything God wants his people to obey and do. The specific term “law of Moses” refers to the commandments and instructions that God gave Moses for the Israelites to obey.

* Depending on the context, the “law” can refer to:

    + the Ten Commandments that God wrote on stone tablets for the Israelites
        + all the laws given to Moses
        + the first five books of the Old Testament
        + the entire Old Testament (also referred to as “scriptures” in the New Testament).
        + all of God’s instructions and will
* The phrase “the Law and the Prophets” is used in the New Testament to refer to the Hebrew scriptures (or “Old Testament”)

Translation Suggestions:

* These terms could be translated using the plural, “laws,” since they refer to many instructions.
* The term “law of Moses” could be translated as “the laws that God told Moses to give to the Israelites.”
* Depending on the context, “the law of Moses” could also be translated as “the law that God told to Moses” or “God’s laws that Moses wrote down” or “the laws that God told Moses to give to the Israelites.”
* Ways to translate “the law” or “law of God” or “God’s laws” could include “laws from God” or “God’s commands” or “laws that God gave” or “everything that God commands” or “all of God’s instructions.”
* The phrase “law of Yahweh” could also be translated as “Yahweh’s laws” or “laws that Yahweh said to obey” or “laws from Yahweh” or “things Yahweh commanded.”

## Lawful (id: 26816)

lawful, unlawful, not lawful, lawless, lawlessness
==================================================

Definition:
-----------

The term “lawful” refers to something that is permitted to be done according to a law or other requirement. The opposite of this is “unlawful,” which simply means “not lawful.”

* In the Bible, something was “lawful” if it was permitted by God’s moral law, or by the Law of Moses and other Jewish laws. Something that was “unlawful” was “not permitted” by those laws.
* To do something “lawfully” means to do it “properly” or “in the right way.”
* Many of the things that the Jewish laws considered lawful or not lawful were not in agreement with God’s laws about loving others.
* Depending on the context, ways to translate “lawful” could include “permitted” or “according to God’s law” or “following our laws” or “proper” or “fitting.”
* The phrase “Is it lawful?” could also be translated as “Do our laws allow?” or “Is that something our laws permit?”

The terms “unlawful” and “not lawful” are used to describe actions that break a law.

* In the New Testament, the term “unlawful” is not only used to refer to breaking God’s laws, but also often refers to breaking Jewish man\-made laws.
* Over the years, the Jews added to the laws that God gave to them. The Jewish leaders would call something “unlawful” if it did not conform to their man\-made laws.
* When Jesus and his disciples were picking grain on a Sabbath day, the Pharisees accused them of doing something “unlawful” because it was breaking the Jewish laws about not working on that day.
* When Peter stated that eating unclean foods was “unlawful” for him, he meant that if he ate those foods he would be breaking the laws God had given the Israelites about not eating certain foods.

The term “lawless” describes a person who does not obey laws or rules. When a country or group of people are in a state of “lawlessness,” there is widespread disobedience, rebellion, or immorality.

* A lawless person is rebellious and does not obey God’s laws.
* The apostle Paul wrote that in the last days there will be a “man of lawlessness,” or a “lawless one,” who will be influenced by Satan to do evil things.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term “unlawful” should be translated using a word or expression that means “not lawful” or “lawbreaking.”
* Other ways to translate “unlawful” could be “not permitted” or “not according to God’s law” or “not conforming to our laws.”
* The expression “against the law” has the same meaning as “unlawful.”
* The term “lawless” could also be translated as “rebellious” or “disobedient” or “law\-defying”.
* The term “lawlessness” could be translated as “not obeying any laws” or “rebellion (against God’s laws).”
* The phrase “man of lawlessness” could be translated as “man who does not obey any laws” or “man who rebels against God’s laws.”
* It is important to keep the concept of “law” in this term, if possible.
* Note that the term “unlawful” has a different meaning from this term.

* Unlike the other tribes, the tribe of Levi did not inherit a unified area of land in Canaan. Instead, they inherited various cities scattered throughout the regions belonging to the other tribes.
* The tribe of Levi was responsible for taking care of the tabernacle (and later, the temple) and conducting religious rituals, including offering sacrifices and prayers for the Israelite people.
* In the Old Testament, it is not always clear whether the term “Levite” refers generally to a descendant of Levi or specifically to a person who served in the temple helping the priests.
* The Old Testament law prescribed that all priests were to be chosen from the tribe of Levi. The Levite priests were set apart and dedicated for the special work of serving God in the temple.
* Two other men named “Levi” were ancestors of Jesus. Their names are listed in the genealogy in the gospel of Luke.
* Jesus’ disciple Matthew was also called Levi.

* People were created in God’s “likeness,” that is, in his “image.” It means that they have qualities or characteristics that are “like” or “similar to” qualities that God has, such as the ability to think, feel, and communicate.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* In some contexts, the expression “the likeness of” could be translated as “what looked like” or “what appeared to be.”
* The expression “in the likeness of his death” could be translated as “sharing in the experience of his death” or “as if experiencing his death with him.”
* The expression “in the likeness of sinful flesh” could be translated as “being like a sinful human being” or to “be a human being.” Make sure the translation of this expression does not sound like Jesus was sinful.
* “In his own likeness” could also be translated as to “be like him” or “having many of the same qualities that he has.”
* The expression “the likeness of an image of perishable man, of birds, of four\-footed beasts and of creeping things” could be translated as “idols made to look like perishable humans, or animals, such as birds, beasts, and small, crawling things.”

locust
======

Facts:
------

The term “locust” refers to a type of large, flying grasshopper that sometimes flies with many other of its kind in a very destructive swarm that eats all vegetation.

* Locusts and other grasshoppers are large, straight\-winged insects with long, jointed back legs that give them the ability to jump a long distance way.
* In the Old Testament, swarming locusts were referred to figuratively as a symbol or picture of the overwhelming devastation that would come as a result of Israel’s disobedience.
* God sent locusts as one of the ten plagues against the Egyptians.
* The New Testament says that locusts were a main source of food for John the Baptist while he was living in the desert.

## Lord (id: 26831)

lord, Lord, master, sir
=======================

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “lord” generally refers to someone who has ownership or authority over other people. In the Bible, however, the term is used to address many different kinds of people, including God.

* This word is sometimes translated as “master” when addressing Jesus or when referring to someone who owns slaves.
* Some English versions translate this as “sir” in contexts where someone is politely addressing someone of higher status.

When “Lord” is capitalized, it is a title that refers to God. (Note, however, that when it is used as a form of addressing someone or it occurs at the beginning of a sentence it may be capitalized and have the meaning of “sir” or “master.”)

* In the Old Testament, this term is also used in expressions such as “Lord God Almighty” or “Lord Yahweh” or “Yahweh our Lord.”
* In the New Testament, the apostles used this term in expressions such as “Lord Jesus” and “Lord Jesus Christ,” which communicate that Jesus is God.
* The term “Lord” in the New Testament is also used alone as a direct reference to God, especially in quotations from the Old Testament. For example, the Old Testament text has “Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh” and the New Testament text has “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.”
* In the ULT and UST, the title “Lord” is only used to translate the actual Hebrew and Greek words that mean “Lord.” It is never used as a translation of God’s name (Yahweh), as is done in many translations.
* Some languages translate “Lord” as “Master” or “Ruler” or some other term that communicates ownership or supreme rule.
* In the appropriate contexts, many translations capitalize the first letter of this term to make it clear to the reader that this is a title referring to God.
* For places in the New Testament where there is a quote from the Old Testament, the term “Lord God” could be used to make it clear that this is a reference to God.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term can be translated with the equivalent of “master” when it refers to a person who owns slaves. It can also be used by a servant to address the person he works for.
* When it refers to Jesus, if the context shows that the speaker sees him as a religious teacher, it can be translated with a respectful address for a religious teacher, such as “master.”
* If the person addressing Jesus does not know him, “lord” could be translated with a respectful form of address such as “sir.” This translation would also be used for other contexts in which a polite form of address to a man is called for.
* When referring to God the Father or to Jesus, this term is considered a title, written as “Lord” (capitalized) in English.

## Lord Yahweh (id: 26833)

Lord Yahweh, Yahweh God
=======================

Facts:
------

In the Old Testament, “Lord Yahweh” is frequently used to refer to the one true God.

* The term “Lord” is a divine title and “Yahweh” is God’s personal name.
* “Yahweh” is also often combined with the term “God” to form “Yahweh God.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* If some form of “Yahweh” is used for the translation of God’s personal name, the terms “Lord Yahweh” and “Yahweh God” can be translated literally. Also consider how the term “Lord” is translated in other contexts when referring to God.
* Some languages put titles after the name and would translate this as “Yahweh Lord.” Consider what is natural in the project language: should the title “Lord” come before or after “Yahweh”?
* “Yahweh God” could also be rendered as “God who is called Yahweh” or “God who is the Living One” or “I am, who is God.”
* If the translation follows the tradition of rendering “Yahweh” as “Lord” or “LORD,” the term “Lord Yahweh” could be translated as “Lord God” or “God who is the Lord.” Other possible translations could be, “Master LORD” or “God the LORD.”
* The term “Lord Yahweh” *should not* be rendered as “Lord LORD” because readers may not notice the difference in letter size that has traditionally been used to distinguish these two words and it would look very strange.

## Lots (id: 26835)

lots, casting lots
==================

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, a “lot” is a marked object(s) used as a way of making a fair and/or random decision, usually for the purpose of selecting a specific person within a group. “Casting lots” refers to the process of using “lots” to make a fair and/or random decision.

* In modern times, some cultures “draw” or “pull out” lots using a bunch of straws. Someone holds the straws so that no one can see how long they are. Each person pulls out a straw and the one who picks the longest (or shortest) straw is the one who is chosen.
* In biblical times, the objects cast (the “lots”) were probably small marked stones. It is unknown how the “lots” actually indicated a decision, but it probably involved dropping or throwing marked stones on the ground.
* The phrase “casting lots” can be translated as “tossing lots” or “throwing lots” or “rolling lots.” The translation of “cast” should not sound like the lots were being thrown a long distance.
* If a decision is made “by lot,” this could be translated as “by casting lots” or “by throwing lots,” etc.

## Love (id: 26836)

love, beloved
=============

Definition:
-----------

To love another person is to care for that person and do things that will benefit him. There are different meanings for “love” some languages may express using different words:

1. The kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others even when it doesn’t benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. God himself is love and is the source of true love.

    * Jesus showed this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.
        * When people love others with this kind of love, they act in ways that show they are thinking of what will cause the others to thrive. This kind of love especially includes forgiving others.
        * In the ULT, the word “love” refers to this kind of sacrificial love, unless a Translation Note indicates a different meaning.
2. Another word in the New Testament refers to brotherly love, or love for a friend or family member.

    * This term refers to natural human love between friends or relatives.
        * The term can also be used in such contexts as, “They love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet.” This means that they “like very much” or “greatly desire” to do that.
3. The word “love” can also refer to romantic love between a man and a woman.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Unless indicated otherwise in a Translation Note, the word “love” in the ULT refers to the kind of sacrificial love that comes from God.
* Some languages may have a special word for the kind of unselfish, sacrificial love that God has. Ways to translate this might include, “devoted, faithful caring” or “care for unselfishly” or “love from God.” Make sure that the word used to translate God’s love can include giving up one’s own interests to benefit others and loving others no matter what they do.
* Sometimes the English word “love” describes the deep caring that people have for friends and family members. Some languages might translate this with a word or phrase that means “like very much” or “care for” or “have strong affection for.”
* In contexts where the word “love” is used to express a strong preference for something, this could be translated by “strongly prefer” or “like very much” or “greatly desire.”
* Some languages may also have a separate word that refers to romantic or sexual love between a husband and wife.
* Many languages must express “love” as an action. So for example, they might translate “love is patient, love is kind” as, “when a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him.”

## Lover (id: 26837)

lover
=====

Definition:
-----------

The term “lover” literally means “person who loves.” Usually this refers to people who are in a sexual relationship with each other.

* When the term “lover” is used in the Bible, it usually refers to a person who is involved in a sexual relationship with someone he or she is not married to.
* This wrong sexual relationship is often used in the Bible to refer to Israel’s disobedience to God in worshiping idols. So the term “lovers” is also used in a figurative way to refer to the idols that the people of Israel worshiped. In these contexts, this term could possibly be translated by “immoral partners” or “partners in adultery” or “idols.” \[See Metaphor]
* A “lover” of money is someone who puts too much importance on getting money and being rich.
* In the Old Testament book Song of Songs, the term “lover” is used in a positive way.
