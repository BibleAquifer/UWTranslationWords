## Caesar (id: 26420)

Caesar
======

Facts:
------

The term “Caesar” was the name or title used by many of the rulers of the Roman Empire. In the Bible, this name refers to three different Roman rulers.

* The first Roman ruler named Caesar was “Caesar Augustus,” who was ruling during the time that Jesus was born.
* About thirty years later, at the time when John the Baptist was preaching, Tiberius Caesar was the ruler of the Roman Empire.
* Tiberius Caesar was still ruling Rome when Jesus told the people to pay Caesar what was due him and to give to God what is due him.
* When Paul appealed to Caesar, this referred to the Roman emperor, Nero, who also had the title “Caesar.”
* When “Caesar” is used by itself as a title, it can also be translated as: “the Emperor” or “the Roman Ruler.”
* In names such as Caesar Augustus or Tiberius Caesar, “Caesar” can be spelled close to the way a national language spells it.

* Often a word meaning “anointed (one)” is used in the Old Testament to refer to the Messiah who would come.
* Jesus fulfilled many of these prophecies and did many miraculous works that proves he is the Messiah; the rest of these prophecies will be fulfilled when he returns.
* The word “Christ” is often used as a title, as in “the Christ” and “Christ Jesus.”
* “Christ” also came to be used as part of his name, as in “Jesus Christ.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term could be translated using its meaning, “the Anointed One” or “God’s Anointed Savior.”
* Many languages use a transliterated word that looks or sounds like “Christ” or “Messiah.” (See: How to Translate Unknowns)
* The transliterated word could be followed by the definition of the term as in, “Christ, the Anointed One.”
* Be consistent in how this is translated throughout the Bible so that it is clear that the same term is being referred to.
* Make sure the translations of “Messiah” and “Christ” work well in contexts where both terms occur in the same verse (such as John 1:41\).

## Christian (id: 26446)

Christian
=========

Definition:
-----------

Some time after Jesus went back to heaven, people made up the name “Christian” which means “follower of Christ.”

* It was in the city of Antioch where Jesus’ followers were first called “Christians.”
* A Christian is a person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God, and who trusts Jesus to save him from his sins.
* In our modern times, often the term “Christian” is used for someone who identifies with the Christian religion, but who is not really following Jesus. This is not the meaning of “Christian” in the Bible.
* Because the term “Christian” in the Bible always refers to someone who truly believes in Jesus, a Christian is also called a “believer.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term could be translated as “Christ\-follower” or “follower of Christ” or perhaps something like, “Christ\-person.”
* Make sure that the translation of this term is translated differently than terms used for disciple or apostle.
* Be careful to translate this term with a word that can refer to everyone who believes in Jesus, not just certain groups.
* Also consider how this term is translated in a Bible translation in a local or national language. (See: How to Translate Unknowns)

## Church (id: 26448)

church, Church
==============

Definition:
-----------

In the New Testament, the term “church” refers to all people who believe in Jesus. Sometimes “church” refers to a part of that larger group who regularly met together in a certain place, such as the “church at Ephesus.”

* This term literally refers to an assembly or congregation of people who were “called out” of the general population to meet together for a special purpose.
* Often the believers in a particular city would meet together in someone’s home to pray together and to hear and discuss scripture. These local churches were given the name of the city such as the “church at Ephesus.”
* In the Bible, “church” does not refer to a building.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “church” could be translated as a “gathering together” or “assembly” or “congregation” or “ones who meet together.”
* The word or phrase that is used to translate this term should also be able to refer to all believers, not just one small group.
* Make sure that the translation of “church” does not just refer to a building.
* The term used to translate “assembly” in the Old Testament could also be used to translate this term.
* Also consider how it is translated in a local or national Bible translation. (See: How to Translate Unknowns.)

## Circumcise (id: 26450)

circumcise, circumcised, circumcision, uncircumcised, uncircumcision
====================================================================

Definition:
-----------

The term “circumcise” means to cut off the foreskin of a man or male child. A circumcision ceremony may be performed in connection with this.

* God commanded Abraham to circumcise every male among his family and servants as a sign of God’s covenant with them.
* God also commanded Abraham’s descendants to continue to do this for every baby boy born into their households.
* The phrase, “circumcision of the heart” refers figuratively to the “cutting away” or removal of sin from a person.
* In a spiritual sense, “the circumcised” refers to people whom God has purified from sin through the blood of Jesus and who are his people.
* The term “uncircumcised” refers to those who have not been circumcised physically. It can also refer figuratively to those who have not been circumcised spiritually, who do not have a relationship with God.

The terms “uncircumcised” and “uncircumcision” refer to a male who has not been physically circumcised. These terms are also used figuratively.

* Egypt was a nation that also required circumcision. So when God talks about Egypt being defeated by the “uncircumcised,” he is referring to people whom the Egyptians despised for not being circumcised.
* The Bible refers to people who have an “uncircumcised heart” or who are “uncircumcised in heart.” This a figurative way of saying that these people are not God’s people, and are stubbornly disobedient to him.
* If a word for circumcision is used or known in the language, “uncircumcised” could be translated as “not circumcised.”
* The expression “the uncircumcision” could be translated as “people who are not circumcised” or “people who do not belong to God,” depending on the context.
* Other ways to translate figurative senses of this term could include “not God’s people” or “rebellious like those who don’t belong to God” or “people who have no sign of belonging to God.”
* The expression “uncircumcised in heart” could be translated as “stubbornly rebellious” or “refusing to believe.” However, if possible it is best to keep the expression or a similar one since spiritual circumcision is an important concept.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* If the culture of the target language performs circumcisions on males, the word used to refer to this should be used for this term.
* Other ways to translate this term would be, “cut around” or “cut in a circle” or “cut off the foreskin.”
* In cultures where circumcision is not known, it may be necessary to explain it in a footnote or glossary.
* Make sure the term used to translate this does not refer to females. It may be necessary to translate this with a word or phrase that includes the meaning of “male.”

## Clean (id: 26454)

clean, wash
===========

Definition:
-----------

The term “clean” generally refers either to removing dirt or stains from someone/something or to not having any dirt or stain in the first place. The term “wash” refers specifically to action of removing dirt or stains from someone/something.

* “Cleanse” is the process of making something “clean.” It could also be translated as “wash” or “purify.”
* In the Old Testament, God told the Israelites which animals he had specified as ritually “clean” and which ones were “unclean.” Only the clean animals were permitted to be used for eating or for sacrifice. In this context, the term “clean” means that the animal was acceptable to God for use as a sacrifice.
* A person who had certain skin diseases would be unclean until the skin was healed enough to no longer be contagious. Instructions for cleansing the skin had to be obeyed in order for that person to be declared “clean” again.
* Sometimes “clean” is used figuratively to refer to moral purity, meaning to be “clean” from sin.

In the Bible, the term “unclean” is used figuratively to refer to things that God declared to be unfit for his people to touch, eat, or sacrifice.

* God gave the Israelites instructions about which animals were “clean” and which ones were “unclean.” The unclean animals were not permitted to be used for eating or for sacrifice.
* People with certain skin diseases were said to be “unclean” until they were healed.
* If the Israelites touched something “unclean,” they themselves would be considered unclean for a certain period of time.
* Obeying God’s commands about not touching or eating unclean things kept the Israelites set apart for God’s service.
* This physical and ritual uncleanness was also symbolic of moral uncleanness.
* In another figurative sense, an “unclean spirit” refers to an evil spirit.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term could be translated with the common word for “clean” or “pure” (in the sense of being not dirty).
* Other ways to translate this could include, “ritually clean” or “acceptable to God.”
* “Cleanse” could be translated by “wash” or “purify.”
* Make sure that the words used for “clean” and “cleanse” can also be understood in a figurative sense.
* The term “unclean” could also be translated as “not clean” or “unfit in God’s eyes” or “physically unclean” or “defiled.”
* When referring to a demon as an unclean spirit, “unclean” could be translated as “evil” or “defiled.”
* The translation of this term should allow for spiritual uncleanness. It should be able to refer to anything that God declared as unfit for touching, eating, or sacrifice.

## Cornerstone (id: 26472)

cornerstone
===========

Definition:
-----------

The term “cornerstone” refers to a large stone that has been specially cut and placed in the corner of the foundation of a building.

* All the other stones of the building are measured and placed in relation to the cornerstone.
* It is very important for the strength and stability of the whole structure.
* In the New Testament, the Assembly of believers is metaphorically compared to a building which has Jesus Christ as its “cornerstone.”
* In the same way that the cornerstone of a building supports and determines the position of the whole building, so Jesus Christ is the cornerstone on which the Assembly of believers is founded and supported.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “cornerstone” could also be translated as “main building stone” or “foundation stone.”
* Consider whether the target language has a term for a part of a building’s foundation that is the main support. If so, this term could be used.
* Another way to translate this would be, “a foundation stone used for the corner of a building.”
* It is important to keep the fact that this is a large stone, used as a solid and secure building material. If stones are not used for constructing buildings, there may be another word that could be used that means “large stone” (such as “boulder”) but it should also have the idea of being well\-formed and made to fit.

## Covenant (id: 26479)

covenant
========

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “covenant” refers to a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.

* This agreement can be between individuals, between groups of people, or between God and people.
* When people make a covenant with each other, they promise that they will do something, and they must do it.
* Examples of human covenants include marriage covenants, business agreements, and treaties between countries.
* Throughout the Bible, God made several different covenants with his people.
* In some of the covenants, God promised to fulfill his part without conditions. For example, when God established his covenant with mankind promising to never destroy the earth again with a worldwide flood, this promise had no conditions for people to fulfill.
* In other covenants, God promised to fulfill his part only if the people obeyed him and fulfilled their part of the covenant.

The term “new covenant” refers to the commitment or agreement God made with his people through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus.

* God’s “new covenant” was explained in the part of the Bible called the “New Testament.”
* This new covenant is in contrast to the “old” or “former” covenant that God had made with the Israelites in Old Testament times.
* The new covenant is better than the old one because it is based on the sacrifice of Jesus, which completely atoned for people’s sins forever. The sacrifices made under the old covenant did not do this.
* God writes the new covenant on the hearts those who become believers in Jesus. This causes them to want to obey God and to begin to live holy lives.
* The new covenant will be completely fulfilled in the end times when God establishes his reign on earth. Everything will once again be very good, as it was when God first created the world.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, ways to translate this term could include, “binding agreement” or “formal commitment” or “pledge” or “contract.”
* Some languages may have different words for covenant depending on whether one party or both parties have made a promise they must keep. If the covenant is one\-sided, it could be translated as “promise” or “pledge.”
* Make sure the translation of this term does not sound like people proposed the covenant. In all cases of covenants between God and people, it was God who initiated the covenant.
* The term “new covenant” could be translated as “new formal agreement” or “new pact” or “new contract.”
* The word “new” in these expressions has the meaning of “fresh” or “new kind of” or “another.”

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

* **4:9** Then God made a **covenant** with Abram. A **covenant** is an agreement between two parties.
* **5:4** “I will make Ishmael a great nation, too, but my **covenant** will be with Isaac.”
* **6:4** After a long time, Abraham died and all of the promises that God had made to him in the **covenant** were passed on to Isaac.
* **7:10** “The **covenant** promises God had promised to Abraham and then to Isaac now passed on to Jacob.”
* **13:2** God said to Moses and the people of Israel, “If you will obey my voice and keep my **covenant**, you will be my prized possession, a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.”
* **13:4** Then God gave them the **covenant** and said, “I am Yahweh, your God, who saved you from slavery in Egypt. Do not worship other gods.”
* **15:13** Then Joshua reminded the people of their obligation to obey the **covenant** that God had made with the Israelites at Sinai.
* **21:5** Through the prophet Jeremiah, God promised that he would make a **New Covenant**, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai. In the **New Covenant**, God would write his law on the people’s hearts, the people would know God personally, they would be his people, and God would forgive their sins. The Messiah would start the **New Covenant**.
* **21:14** Through the Messiah’s death and resurrection, God would accomplish his plan to save sinners and start the **New Covenant**.
* **38:5** Then Jesus took a cup and said, “Drink this. It is my blood of the **New Covenant** that is poured out for the forgiveness of sins. Do this to remember me every time you drink it.”
* **48:11** But God has now made a **New Covenant** that is available to everyone. Because of this **New Covenant**, anyone from any people group can become part of God’s people by believing in Jesus.

## Cow (id: 26481)

cow, bull, calf, cattle, heifer, ox
===================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “cow,” “bull,” “heifer,” “ox,” and “cattle” all refer to a kind of large, four\-legged bovine animal that eats grass.

* The female of this kind of animal is called a “cow,” the male is a “bull,” and their offspring is a “calf.”
* In the Bible, cattle were among the “clean” animals that the people could eat and use for sacrifice. They were primarily raised for their meat and milk.

A “heifer” is an adult female cow that has not yet given birth to a calf.

An “ox” is a type of cattle that is specifically trained to do agricultural work. The plural of this term is “oxen.” Usually oxen are male and have been castrated.

* Throughout the Bible, oxen were depicted as animals tied together by a yoke to pull a cart or a plow.
* Having oxen work together under a yoke was such a common occurrence in the Bible that the phrase to “be under a yoke” became a metaphor for hard work and labor.
* A bull is also a male type of cattle, but it has not been castrated and has not been trained as a work animal.

## Creation (id: 26482)

create, created, creation, creator
==================================

Definition:
-----------

The term “create” means to make something or to cause something to be. Whatever is created is called a “creation.” God is called the “Creator” because he caused everything in the entire universe to come into existence.

* When this term is used to refer to God creating the world, it means he made it out of nothing.
* When human beings “create” something, it means they made it out of things that already existed.
* Sometimes “create” is used in a figurative way to describe something abstract, such as creating peace, or creating a pure heart in someone.
* The term “creation” can refer to the very beginning of the world when God first created everything. It can also be used to refer generally to everything that God created. Sometimes the word “creation” refers more specifically to just the people in the world.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Some languages may have to directly say that God created the world “out of nothing” to make sure this meaning is clear.
* The phrase, “since the creation of the world” means “since the time when God created the world.”
* A similar phrase, “at the beginning of creation” could be translated as “when God created the world at the beginning of time,” or “when the world was first created.”
* To preach the good news to “all creation” means to preach the good news to “all people everywhere on earth.”
* The phrase “Let all creation rejoice” means “Let everything that God created rejoice.”
* Depending on the context, “create” could be translated as “make” or “cause to be” or “make out of nothing.”
* The term “the Creator” could be translated as “the One who created everything” or “God, who made the whole world.”
* Phrases like “your Creator” could be translated as “God, who created you.”

==================

Definition:
-----------

Translation Suggestions

## Curtain (id: 26491)

curtain
=======

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “curtain” refers to a very thick, heavy piece of material used in the making of the tabernacle and the temple.

* The tabernacle was built using four layers of curtains for the top and sides. These curtain coverings were made of cloth or animal skins.
* Cloth curtains were also used to form a wall surrounding the tabernacle courtyard. These curtains were made out of “linen” which was a kind of cloth made out of the flax plant.
* In both the tabernacle and temple building, a thick cloth curtain hung between the holy place and the most holy place. It was this curtain that was miraculously torn into two parts when Jesus died.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Since modern\-day curtains are very different from the curtains used in the Bible, it may be more clear to use a different word or to add words that describe the curtains.
* Depending on the context, ways to translate this term could include, “curtain covering” or “covering” or “piece of thick cloth” or “animal skin covering” or “hanging piece of cloth.”
