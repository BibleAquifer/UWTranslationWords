## Hades (id: 26667)

Hades, Sheol
============

Definition:
-----------

The terms “Hades” (in Greek) and “Sheol” (in Hebrew) are proper names for the place where the spirits of dead people would go after they had died.

* In these ancient cultures, people thought of this as an underground dwelling place where the spirits of dead people existed in a shadowy, semi\-conscious form.
* Although these terms are place names, in the Bible they often mean the same thing as "death" or "the grave."
* Throughout most of biblical history, “Sheol” and “Hades” refer to a neutral place where all of the dead go to await judgment, both the righteous and the unrighteous. In the New Testament, however, “Hades” begins to be seen as a place for only the unrighteous, in contrast with “Abraham's side” (Luke 16:22\) or “paradise” (Luke 23:43\), which describe the place for the righteous.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* Both “Sheol” and “Hades” can be translated in various ways, depending on the context. Some possibilities include: “place of the dead,” “place for dead spirits,” “the underworld,” “the pit,” “the grave,” or “death.”
* Some translations keep the proper names “Sheol” and “Hades,” spelling them to fit the sound patterns of the language of translation. (See: How to Translate Unknowns).
* A phrase could also be added to each term to explain it. Examples of doing this are, “Sheol, place where dead people are” and “Hades, place of death.”

## Hang (id: 26675)

hang, hung
==========

Definition:
-----------

The term “hang” means to suspend something or someone above the ground.

* In modern times, death by hanging is usually done by tying a rope around a person’s neck and suspending him from an elevated object until he dies. This elevated object can be any number of things, such as a tree or a gallows, that is, a platform built specifically for the purpose of hanging a person in order to kill him.
* In biblical times, however, ancient cultures may not have killed people by hanging in precisely the same way. For example, Jesus died while hanging on a wooden cross (sometimes called a “tree”), but there was nothing around his neck. The soldiers suspended him by nailing his hands (or wrists) and his feet to the cross.
* Some ancient cultures “hung” a person by impaling him on a wooden pole in such a way that he was suspended above the ground so that he could not escape. The person would be left there until he died.
* For many references to death by “hanging” in the Bible, the specific means of death is unknown.

## Hebrew (id: 26684)

Hebrew
======

Facts:
------

The term “Hebrew” refers in a very general sense to the people group descended from Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob.

* The specific word “Hebrew” can refer either to a individual person in the people group or to the language spoken by that people group.
* The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in the language called “Hebrew.” However, in most cases in the New Testament, the specific term “Hebrew” probably refers to the Aramaic language rather than the Hebrew language.
* In different places in the Bible, the Hebrews were also called “Israelites” or “Jews.” When translating, it is best to keep all three terms distinct in the text, as long as it is clear that these terms refer to the same people group.

## Hebron (id: 26685)

Hebron, Kiriath Arba
====================

Facts:
------

Hebron was a city located in the high, rocky hills about 20 miles south of Jerusalem.

* The city was built around 2000 BC during the time of Abram. It was mentioned many times in the historical accounts given in the Old Testament.
* Hebron had a very important role in King David’s life. Several of his sons, including Absalom, were born there.
* The city was destroyed around AD 70 by the Romans.
* The city of Hebron was formerly called Kiriath Arba (see Joshua 14:15 and Joshua 15:54\).
* The city of Hebron, formerly called Kiriath Arba, was probably founded by Arba, the father of Anak and may have been originally named Kiriath Arba to honor Arba because Joshua 14:15 records that Arba “was a great man among the Anakites.”
* The name “Hebron” is an English transliteration of the Hebrew word for Hebron.

## Hell (id: 26687)

hell, lake of fire
==================

Definition:
-----------

Hell is the final place of unending pain and suffering where God will punish everyone who rebels against him and rejects his plan of saving them through Jesus’ sacrifice. It is also referred to as the “lake of fire.”

* Hell is described as a place of fire and severe suffering.
* Satan and the evil spirits who follow him will be thrown into hell for eternal punishment.
* People who do not believe in Jesus’ sacrifice for their sin and do not trust in him to save them, will be punished forever in hell.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* These terms should probably be translated differently since they occur in different contexts.
* Some languages cannot use “lake” in the phrase “lake of fire” because it refers to water.
* The term “hell” could be translated as “place of suffering” or “final place of darkness and pain.”
* The term “lake of fire” could also be translated as “sea of fire” or “huge fire (of suffering)” or “field of fire.”

## High Places (id: 26693)

high place
==========

Definition:
-----------

The term “high places” refers to the altars and shrines that were used for worshiping idols. They were usually built on higher ground, such as on a hill or mountainside.

* Many of the kings of Israel sinned against God by building altars to false gods on these high places. This led the people to become deeply involved in worshiping idols.
* It often happened that when a God\-fearing king started ruling in Israel or Judah, often he would remove the high places or altars in order to stop the worship of these idols.
* However, some of these good kings were careless and did not remove the high places, which resulted in the entire nation of Israel would continue to worship idols.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Other ways to translate this term could include “elevated places for idol worship” or “hilltop idol shrines” or “idol altar mounds.”
* Make sure it is clear that this term refers to the idol altars, not just to the high place where those altars were located.

## High Priest (id: 26694)

high priest, chief priests
==========================

Definition:
-----------

The term “high priest” refers to a special priest who was appointed to serve for one year as the leader of all of the other Israelite priests. In New Testament times, some other priests were also considered very important Jewish religious leaders, with authority over other priests and the people. These were the chief priests.

* The high priest had special responsibilities. He was the only one who was permitted to go into the most holy part of the tabernacle or the temple to offer a special sacrifice once per year.
* The Israelites had many priests, but only one high priest at a time.
* After high priests retired, they still kept the title, along with some of the responsibilities of the office. For example, Annas was still referred to as high priest during the priesthood of Caiaphas and others.
* The chief priests were responsible for everything needed for the worship services at the temple. They were also in charge of the money that was given to the temple.
* The chief priests were higher in rank and power than the ordinary priests. Only the high priest had more authority.
* The chief priests were some of Jesus’ main enemies and they strongly influenced the Roman leaders to arrest and kill him.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* “High priest” could be translated as “supreme priest” or “highest ranking priest.”
* The term “chief priests” could be translated as “head priests” or “leading priests” or “ruling priests.”

## Holy (id: 26698)

holy, holiness, unholy, sacred
==============================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “holy” and “holiness” refer to the character of God that is totally set apart and separated from everything that is sinful and imperfect.

* Only God is absolutely holy. He makes people and things holy.
* A person who is holy belongs to God and has been set apart for the purpose of serving God and bringing him glory.
* An object that God has declared to be holy is one that he has set apart for his glory and use, such as an altar that is for the purpose of offering sacrifices to him.
* People cannot approach him unless he allows them to, because he is holy and they are merely human beings, sinful and imperfect.
* In the Old Testament, God set apart the priests as holy for special service to him. They had to be ceremonially cleansed from sin in order to approach God.
* God also set apart as holy certain places and things that belonged to him or in which he revealed himself, such as his temple.

Literally, the term “unholy” means “not holy.” It describes someone or something that does not honor God.

* This word is used to describe someone who dishonors God by rebelling against him.
* A thing that is called “unholy” could be described as being common, profane or unclean. It does not belong to God.

The term “sacred” describes something that relates to worshiping God or to the pagan worship of false gods.

* In the Old Testament, the term “sacred” was oftensed to describe the stone pillars and other objects used in the worship of false gods. This could also be translated as “religious.”
* “Sacred songs” and “sacred music” refer to music that was sung or played for God’s glory. This could be translated as “music for worshiping Yahweh” or “songs that praise God.”
* The phrase “sacred duties” referred to the “religious duties” or “rituals” that a priest performed to lead people in worshiping God. It could also refer to the rituals performed by a pagan priest to worship a false god.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

## Honey (id: 26703)

honey, honeycomb
================

Definition:
-----------

“Honey” is the sweet, sticky, edible substance that honeybees make out of flower nectar. Honeycomb is the waxy frame where the bees store honey.

* Depending on the kind, honey can be yellowish or brownish in color.
* Honey can be found in the wild, such as in the hollow of a tree, or wherever bees make a nest. People also raise bees in hives in order to produce honey to eat or sell, but probably the honey mentioned in the Bible was wild honey.
* Three people that the Bible specifically mentions as eating wild honey were Jonathan, Samson, and John the Baptist.
* This term is often used figuratively to describe something that is sweet or very pleasurable. For example, God’s words and decrees are said to be “sweeter than honey.” (See also: Simile, Metaphor)
* Sometimes a person’s words are described as seeming sweet like honey, but instead result in deceiving and harming others.

## Hope (id: 26705)

hope, hoped
===========

Definition:
-----------

Hope is strongly desiring something to happen. Hope can imply either certainty or uncertainty regarding a future event.

* In the Bible, the term “hope” also has the meaning of “trust,” as in “my hope is in the Lord.” It refers to a sure expectation of receiving what God has promised his people.
* Sometimes the ULT translates the term in the original language as “confidence.” This happens mostly in the New Testament in situations where people who believe in Jesus as their Savior have the assurance (or confidence or hope) of receiving what God has promised.
* To have “no hope” means to have no expectation of something good happening. It means that it is actually very certain that it will not happen.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* In some contexts, the term to “hope” could also be translated as to “wish” or to “desire” or to “expect.”
* The expression “nothing to hope for” could be translated as “nothing to trust in” or “no expectation of anything good”
* To “have no hope” could be translated as “have no expectation of anything good” or “have no security” or “be sure that nothing good will happen.”
* The expression “have set your hopes on” could also be translated as “have put your confidence in” or “have been trusting in.”
* The phrase “I find hope in your Word” could also be translated as “I am confident that your Word is true” or “Your Word helps me trust in you” or “When I obey your Word, I am certain to be blessed.”
* Phrases such as “hope in” God could also be translated a, “trust in God” or “know for sure that God will do what he has promised” or “be certain that God is faithful.”

## Horn (id: 26706)

horn, horns, horned
===================

Facts:
------

Horns are permanent, hard, pointed growths on the heads of many types of animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, and deer.

* The horn of a ram (male sheep) was made into a musical instrument called a “ram’s horn” or “shofar,” which was blown for special events such as religious festivals.
* This term should be translated with a word that is different from the word that refers to a trumpet.
* God told the Israelites to make a horn\-shaped projection on each of the four corners of the incense and brazen altars. Although these projections were called “horns,” they were not actually animal horns.
* The term “horn” was sometimes used to refer to a “flask” that was shaped like a horn and was used for holding water or oil. A flask of oil was used for anointing a king, as Samuel did with David.
