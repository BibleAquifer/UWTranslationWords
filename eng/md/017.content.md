## People of God (id: 26942)

people of God
=============

Definition:
-----------

The concept of the “people of God” in the Bible refers to people with whom God has established a covenant relationship.

* In the Old Testament, the phrase “people of God” refers to the nation of Israel. The nation of Israel was chosen by God and set apart from the other nations of the world in order to serve and obey him.
* In the New Testament, the phrase “people of God” refers to the “Church,” meaning everyone who believes in Jesus. This includes both Jews and Gentiles. In the New Testament, sometimes this group of people is called the “sons of God” or “children of God.”
* When God uses the phrase “my people,” he is referring to people who have a covenant relationship with him. God’s people are chosen by him, and he wants them to live in a way that is pleasing to him.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “people of God” could be translated as “God’s people” or “the people who worship God” or “people who serve God” or “people who belong to God.”
* When God says “my people” other ways to translate it could include “the people I have chosen” or “the people who worship me” or “the people who belong to me.”
* Similarly, “your people” could be translated as “the people who belong to you” or “the people you chose to belong to you.”
* Also “his people” could be translated as “the people who belong to him” or “the people God chose to belong to himself.”

## Perfect (id: 26944)

In the New Testament, the term “perfect” means to be mature in our Christian life. To perfect something means to work at it until it is excellent and without flaws. Old Testament sacrifices needed to be “perfect” or “complete,” that is, without blemish.

* The term “perfect” also has the meaning of being “complete” or “whole.”
* The New Testament book of James states that persevering through trials will produce completeness and maturity in the believer.
* When Christians study the Bible and obey it, they will become more spiritually perfect and mature because they will be more like Christ in their character.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term could be translated as “without flaw” or “without error” or “flawless” or “without fault” or “not having any faults.”

## Perish (id: 26945)

perish
======

Definition:
-----------

The term “perish” means to die or be destroyed, usually as the result of violence or disaster. In the New Testament, it often has the spiritual meaning of being lost or separated from the people of God.

### Spiritual Meaning of “Perish:”

* People who are “perishing” are those who have refused to trust in Jesus for their salvation.
* Those who “perish” will not live eternally with God in heaven. Instead, they will live eternally in hell under God’s punishment.
* Everyone will die physically, but only those who do not trust in Jesus for their salvation will perish eternally.
* When “perish” is used in a spiritual sense, make sure that your translation expresses this differently than dying physically.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, ways to translate this term could include “be lost from God’s people,” “die eternally,” “be punished in hell,” or “be destroyed.”
* Try to use a term or expression that does not only mean “die physically” or “cease to exist.”

## Perizzite (id: 26946)

Perizzite
=========

Facts:
------

The Perizzites were one of several people groups in the land of Canaan. Little is known about this group as to who their ancestors were or what part of Canaan they lived in.

* The Perizzites are mentioned most frequently in the Old Testament Book of Judges, where it is recorded that the Perizzites intermarried with the Israelites and influenced them to worship false gods.
* Note that the clan of Perez, called the “Perezites,” was a different people group from the Perizzites. It may be necessary to spell the names very differently to make this clear.

In the early Christian church in Jerusalem, Philip was one of seven leaders chosen to care for the poor and needy Christians, especially the widows.

* God used Philip to share the gospel with people in many different towns in the provinces of Judea and Galilee, including an Ethiopian man he met on the desert road to Gaza from Jerusalem.
* Years later Philip was living in Caesarea when Paul and his companions stayed at his house on their way back to Jerusalem.
* Most Bible scholars think that Philip the evangelist was not the same man as Jesus’ apostle by that name. Some languages may prefer to use slightly different spellings for the names of these two men to make it clear they are different men.

* “Preaching” and “teaching” are similar, but are not exactly the same.

* The term “preach” is usually used with the word “gospel.”
* What a person has preached to others can also be referred to in general as his “teachings.”
* Often in the Bible, “proclaim” means to announce publicly something that God has commanded, or to tell others about God and how great he is.
* In the New Testament, the apostles proclaimed the good news about Jesus to many people in many different cities and regions.
* The term “proclaim” can also be used for decrees made by kings or for denouncing evil in a public way.
* Other ways to translate “proclaim” could include “announce” or “openly preach” or “publicly declare.”
* The term “proclamation” could also be translated as “announcement” or “public preaching.”

## Priest (id: 26979)

priest, priesthood
==================

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, a priest was someone who was chosen to offer sacrifices to God on behalf of God’s people. The “priesthood” was the name for the office or condition of being a priest.

* In the Old Testament, God chose Aaron and his descendants to be his priests for the people of Israel.
* The “priesthood” was a right and a responsibility that was passed down from father to son in the Levite clan.
* The Israelite priests had the responsibility of offering the people’s sacrifices to God, along with other duties in the temple.
* Priests also offered regular prayers to God on behalf of his people and performed other religious rites.
* The priests pronounced formal blessings on people and taught them God’s laws.
* In Jesus’ time, there were different levels of priests, including the chief priests and the high priest.
* Jesus is our “great high priest” who intercedes for us in God’s presence. He offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. This means that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.
* In the New Testament, every believer in Jesus is called a “priest” who can come directly to God in prayer to intercede for himself and other people.
* In ancient times, there were also pagan priests who presented offerings to false gods such as Baal.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, the term “priest” could be translated as “sacrifice person” or “God’s intermediary” or “sacrificial mediator” or “person God appoints to represent him.”
* The translation of “priest” should be different from the translation of “mediator.”
* Some translations may prefer to always say something like “Israelite priest” or “Jewish priest” or “Yahweh’s priest” or “priest of Baal” to make it clear that this does not refer to a modern\-day type of priest.
* The term used to translate “priest” should be different from the terms for “chief priest” and “high priest” and “Levite” and “prophet.”
