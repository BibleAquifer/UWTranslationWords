## Tabernacle (id: 27136)

tabernacle
==========

Definition:
-----------

The tabernacle was a special tent\-like structure where the Israelites worshiped God during the 40 years they traveled around in the desert.

* God had given the Israelites detailed instructions for building this large tent, which had two rooms and was surrounded by an enclosed courtyard.
* Each time the Israelites moved to a different place in the desert to live, the priests would take the tabernacle apart and carry it to their next campsite. Then they would set it up again in the center of their new camp.
* The tabernacle was constructed of wood frames hung with curtains made of cloth, goat hair, and animal skins. The courtyard surrounding it was enclosed with more curtains.
* The two sections of the tabernacle were the Holy Place (where the altar for burning incense was located) and the Most Holy Place (where the ark of the covenant was kept).
* The courtyard of the tabernacle had an altar for burning animal sacrifices and a special washbasin for ritual cleansing.
* The Israelites stopped using the tabernacle when the temple was built in Jerusalem by Solomon.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The word “tabernacle” means “dwelling place.” Other ways to translate it could include, “sacred tent” or “tent where God was” or “God’s tent.”
* Make sure that the translation of this term is different from the translation of “temple.”

## Tax (id: 27140)

tax, tribute, taxation, taxpayers, tax collector,
=================================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “tax” and “taxes” refer to money or goods that people pay to a government that is in authority over them. A “tax collector” was a government worker whose job was to receive money that people were required to pay the government in taxes.

* The amount of money that is paid as a tax is usually based on the value of an item or on how much a person’s property is worth.
* In the time of Jesus and and the apostles, the Roman government required taxes from everyone living in the Roman empire, including the Jews.
* If taxes are not paid, the government can take legal action against a person to get the money that is owed.
* Joseph and Mary traveled to Bethlehem to be counted in the census held to tax everyone living in the Roman empire.
* The term “tax” could also be translated as “required payment” or “government money” or “temple money,” depending on the context.
* To “pay taxes” could also be translated as to “pay money to the government” or “receive money for the government” or “make the required payment.” To “collect taxes” could be translated as to “receive money for the government.”
* A “tax collector” is someone who works for the government and receives the money that people are required to pay it.
* The people who collected taxes for the Roman government would often demand more money from the people than the government required. The tax collectors would keep the extra amount for themselves.
* Because tax collectors cheated people in this way, the Jews considered them to be among the worst of sinners.
* The Jews also considered Jewish tax collectors to be traitors to their own people because they worked for the Roman government which was oppressing the Jewish people.
* The phrase, “tax collectors and sinners” was a common expression in the New Testament, showing how much the Jews despised tax collectors.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

34:6 He said, “Two men went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a tax collector, and the other was a religious leader.” 34:7 “The religious leader prayed like this, ‘Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector.’” 34:9 “But the tax collector stood far away from the religious ruler, did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest and prayed, ‘God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.’” 34:10 Then Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, God heard the tax collector’s prayer and declared him to be righteous.” 35:1 One day, Jesus was teaching many tax collectors and other sinners who had gathered to hear him.

## Temple (id: 27142)

temple, house, house of God
===========================

Facts:
------

The temple was a building surrounded by walled courtyards where the Israelites came to pray and to offer sacrifices to God. It was located on Mount Moriah in the city of Jerusalem.

* Often the term “temple” referred to the whole temple complex, including the courtyards that surrounded the main building. Sometimes it referred only to the building.
* The temple building had two rooms, the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place.
* God referred to the temple as his dwelling place.
* King Solomon built the Temple during his reign. It was supposed to be the permanent place of worship in Jerusalem.
* In the New Testament, the term “temple of the Holy Spirit” is used to refer to believers in Jesus as a group, because the Holy Spirit lives in them.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Usually when the text says that people were “in the temple,” it is referring to the courtyards outside the building. This could be translated as “in the temple courtyards” or “in the temple complex.”
* Where it refers specifically to the building itself, some translations translate “temple” as “temple building,” to make it the reference clear.
* Ways to translate “temple” could include, “God’s holy house” or “sacred worship place.”
* Often in the Bible, the temple is referred to as “the house of Yahweh” or “the house of God.”

The “Ten Commandments” were commands that God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai while the Israelites were living in the desert on their way to the land of Canaan. God wrote these commands on two large slabs of stone.

* The Israelites also lived in tents during their forty\-year wanderings through the desert of Sinai.
* The tabernacle building was a kind of very large tent, with thick walls made of cloth curtains.
* When the apostle Paul traveled to different cities to share the gospel, he supported himself by making tents.
* The term “tents” is sometimes used figuratively to refer generally to where people live. This could also be translated as “homes” or “dwellings” or “houses” or even “bodies.” (See: synecdoche)

* A witness who gives “false testimony” does not tell the truth about what happened.
* Sometimes the term “testimony” refers to a prophecy that a prophet has stated.
* In the New Testament, this term was often used to refer to how Jesus’ followers testified about the events of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.

The term “witness” refers to a person who has personally experienced something that happened. Usually a witness is also someone who testifies about what they know is true. The term “eyewitness” emphasizes that the person was actually there and saw what happened.

* To “witness” something means to see it happen.
* At a trial, a witness “gives witness” or “bears witness.” This has the same meaning as “testify.”
* Witnesses are expected to tell the truth about what they have seen or heard.
* A witness who does not tell the truth about what happened is called a “false witness.” He is said to “give false witness” or to “bear false witness.”
* The expression “be a witness between” means that something or someone will be evidence that a contract has been made. The witness will make sure each person does what he has promised to do.

## The Twelve (id: 27154)

the twelve, the eleven
======================

Definition:
-----------

The term “the twelve” refers to the twelve men that Jesus chose to be his closest disciples, or apostles. After Judas killed himself, they were called “the eleven.”

* Jesus had many other disciples, but the title “the twelve” distinguished those who were apparently closest to Jesus.
* The names of these twelve disciples are listed in Matthew 10, Mark 3, and Luke 6\.
* Some time after Jesus had returned to heaven, “the eleven” chose a disciple named Matthias to take Judas’ place. Then they were called “the twelve” again.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* For many languages it may be clearer or more natural to add the noun and say, “the twelve apostles” or “Jesus’ twelve closest disciples.”
* “The eleven” could also be translated as “Jesus’ eleven remaining disciples.”
* Some translations may prefer to use a capital letter to show that it was used as a title, as in “the Twelve” and “the Eleven.”

## Thief (id: 27155)

thief, rob, robber, robbery, bandits
====================================

Facts:
------

The term “thief” refers to a person who steals money or property from other people. The plural of “thief” is “thieves.” The term “robber” often refers to a thief who also physically harms or threatens the people he is stealing from.

* Jesus told a parable about a Samaritan man who took care of a Jewish man who had been attacked by robbers. The robbers had beaten the Jewish man and wounded him before stealing his money and clothing.
* Both thieves and robbers come suddenly to steal, when people are not expecting it. Often they use the cover of darkness to hide what they are doing.
* In a figurative sense, the New Testament describes Satan as a thief who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. This means that Satan’s plan is to try to get God’s people to stop obeying him. If he succeeded in doing this Satan would be stealing from them the good things that God has planned for them.
* Jesus compared the suddenness of his return to the suddenness of a thief coming to steal from people. Just as a thief comes at a time when people are not expecting it, so Jesus will return at a time when people do not expect it.

## Thorn (id: 27157)

thorn, thorn bush, thistle
==========================

Facts:
------

Thorn bushes and thistles are plants that have prickly branches or flowers. These plants do not produce fruit or anything else that is useful.

* A “thorn” is a hard, sharp growth on the branch or stem of a plant. A “thornbush” is a type of small tree or shrub that has many thorns on its branches.
* A “thistle” is a plant with prickly stems and leaves. Often the flowers are purple.
* Thorn and thistle plants multiply quickly and can cause nearby plants or crops to not be able to grow. This is a picture of how sin keeps a person from producing good spiritual fruit.
* A crown made of twisted thorn branches was placed on Jesus’ head before he was crucified.
* If possible, these terms should be translated by the names of two different plants or bushes that are known in the language area.

## Thresh (id: 27158)

thresh
======

Definition:
-----------

The terms “thresh” and “threshing” refer to the first part of the process of separating grain from the rest of the plant.

* Threshing a crop loosens the grain from the stalk. Afterwards the grain is “winnowed” to completely separate the seed from all unwanted materials, leaving only the part the grain that can be eaten.
* In Bible times, a “threshing floor” was a large flat rock or an area of packed\-down dirt, giving a hard, level surface to crush the grain stalks and remove the grain.
* A “threshing cart” or “threshing wheel” was sometimes used to crush the grain and help separate it from the straw and chaff.
* A “threshing sledge” or “threshing board” was also used for separating grain. It was made of wooden boards that had sharp metal spikes on the end.

* Sometimes the term “torment” refers to physical pain and suffering. For example, the book of Revelation describes physical torment that worshipers of the “beast” will suffer in the end times.
* Suffering may also take the form of spiritual and emotional pain, as experienced by Job.
* The apostle John wrote in the book of Revelation that people who do not believe in Jesus as their Savior will experience eternal torment in the lake of fire.

## Tradition (id: 27168)

tradition
=========

Definition:
-----------

The term “tradition” refers to a custom or practice that has been kept over time and which is passed down to people in later generations.

* Often in the Bible the word “traditions” referred to teachings and practices that people made, not God’s laws. The expression “tradition of men” or “human tradition” makes this clear.
* Phrases such as “traditions of the elders” or “traditions of my fathers” referred specifically to Jewish customs and practices that Jewish leaders over time had added to the laws God gave to the Israelites through Moses. Even though these added traditions had not come from God, people thought they had to obey them in order to be righteous.
* The apostle Paul used the term “tradition” in a different way to refer to teachings about Christian practice that came from God and that he and other apostles had taught new believers.
* In modern times, there are many Christian traditions that are not taught in the Bible, but rather are the result of historically accepted customs and practices. These traditions should always be evaluated in light of what God teaches us in the Bible.

## Trust (id: 27180)

trust, trusted, trustworthy, trustworthiness
============================================

Definition:
-----------

To “trust” something or someone is to believe that the thing or person is true or dependable. That belief is also called “trust.” A “trustworthy” person is one you can trust to do and say what is right and true, and therefore one who has the quality of “trustworthiness.”

* Trust is closely related to faith. If we trust someone, we have faith in that person to do what they promised to do.
* Having trust in someone also means depending on that person.
* To “trust in” Jesus means to believe that he is God, to believe that he died on the cross to pay for our sins, and to rely on him to save us.
* A “trustworthy saying” refers to something that is said that can be counted on to be true.

Translation Suggestions:

* The term “trustworthy” could be translated as “dependable” or “reliable” or “can always be trusted.”
