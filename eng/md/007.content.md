## False God (id: 26586)

god, false god, goddess, idol, idolater, idolatrous, idolatry
=============================================================

Definition:
-----------

A false god is something that people worship instead of the one true God. The term “goddess” refers specifically to a female false god.

* These false gods or goddesses do not exist. Yahweh is the only God.
* People sometimes make objects into idols to worship as symbols of their false gods.
* In the Bible, God’s people frequently turned away from obeying him in order to worship false gods.
* Demons often deceive people into believing that the false gods and idols they worship have power.
* Baal, Dagon, and Molech were three of the many false gods that were worshiped by people in Bible times.
* Asherah and Artemis (Diana) were two of the goddesses that ancient peoples worshiped.

An idol is an object that people make so they can worship it. Something is described as “idolatrous” if it involves giving honor to something other than the one true God.

* People make idols to represent the false gods that they worship.
* These false gods do not exist; there is no God besides Yahweh.
* Sometimes demons work through an idol to make it seem like it has power, even though it does not.
* Idols are often made of valuable materials like gold, silver, bronze, or expensive wood.
* An “idolatrous kingdom” means a “kingdom of people who worship idols” or a “kingdom of people who worship earthly things.”
* The term “idolatrous figure” is another word for a “carved image” or an “idol.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* There may already be a word for “god” or “false god” in the language or in a nearby language.
* The term “idol” could be used to refer to false gods.
* In English, a lower case “g” is used to refer to false gods, and upper case “G” is used to refer to the one true God. Other languages also do that.
* Another option would be to use a completely different word to refer to the false gods.
* Some languages may add a word to specify whether the false god is described as male or female.

fellowship offering
===================

Facts:
------

In the Old Testament, the “fellowship offering” was a kind of sacrifice that was offered for different reasons, such as to give thanks to God or to fulfill a vow.

* This offering required the sacrifice of an animal that could be male or female. This was different from the burnt offering, which required a male animal.
* After giving a portion of the sacrifice to God, the person who brought the fellowship offering shared the meat with the priests and other Israelites.
* There was a meal associated with this offering which included unleavened bread.
* This is sometimes called the “peace offering.”

==========================

Definition:
-----------

In general, a festival is a celebration held by a community of people.

* The word for “festival” in the Old Testament literally means “appointed time.”
* The festivals celebrated by the Israelites were specially appointed times or seasons that God had commanded them to observe.
* In some English translations, the word “feast” is used instead of festival because the celebrations included having a large meal together.
* There were several main festivals that the Israelites celebrated every year:

    + Passover
        + Festival of Unleavened Bread
        + Firstfruits
        + Festival of Weeks (Pentecost)
        + Festival of Trumpets
        + Day of Atonement
        + Festival of Shelters
* The purpose of these festivals was to thank God and to remember the amazing things he had done to rescue, protect, and provide for his people.

## First Born (id: 26600)

firstborn
=========

Definition:
-----------

The term “firstborn” refers to an offspring of people or animals that is born first, before the other offspring are born.

* In the Bible, “firstborn” usually refers to the first male offspring that is born.
* In Bible times, the firstborn son was given a place of prominence and twice as much of his family inheritance as the other sons.
* Often it was the firstborn male of an animal that was sacrificed to God.
* This concept can also be used figuratively. For example, the nation of Israel is called God’s firstborn son because God gave it special privileges over other nations.
* Jesus, the Son of God is called God’s firstborn because of his importance and authority over everyone else.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* When “first\-born” occurs in the text alone, it could also be translated as “firstborn male” or “firstborn son,” since that is what is implied. (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)
* Other ways to translate this term could include “the son who was born first” or “the eldest son” or “the number one son.”
* When used figuratively to refer to Jesus, this could be translated with a word or phrase that means “the son who has authority over everything” or “the Son who is first in honor.”
* Caution: Make sure the translation of this term in reference to Jesus does not imply that he was created.

## First Fruit (id: 26601)

firstfruits
===========

Definition:
-----------

The term “firstfruits” refers to a portion of the first crop of fruits and vegetables that was reaped during each harvest season.

* The Israelites offered these first fruits to God as a sacrificial offering.
* This term is also used figuratively in the Bible to refer to a firstborn son as being the first fruits of the family. That is, because he was the first son to be born into that family, he was the one who carried on the family name and honor.
* Because Jesus rose from the dead, he is called the “firstfruits” of all believers in him, belivers who have died but who will some day come back to life.
* Believers in Jesus are also called the “firstfruits” of all creation, indicating the special privilege and position of those whom Jesus redeemed and called to be his people.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The literal use of this term could be translated as “first portion (of crops)” or “first part of the harvest.”
* If possible, the figurative uses should be translated literally, to allow for different meanings in different contexts. This will also show the correlation between the literal meaning and the figurative uses.

## Flock (id: 26603)

flock, herd
===========

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, “flock” refers to a group of sheep or goats and “herd” refers to a group of cattle or pigs.

* Different languages may have different ways of naming groups of animals or birds.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* Consider what terms are used in your language to refer to different groups of animals, and use the appropriate term for each kind of animal.
* If your language uses the same word to refer to both groups of sheep and cattle, then you may need to say “groups of sheep” where the Bible says only “flocks,” and “groups of cattle” where the Bible says only “herds.” Alternatively, if the Biblical context does not demand differentiation (if the text simply says “flocks and herds,” meaning all their domesticated animals) you may just use the one word once.

## Flood (id: 26604)

flood
=====

Definition:
-----------

The term “flood” literally refers to a large amount of water that completely covers over the land.

* This term is also used figuratively to refer to an overwhelming amount of something, especially something that happens suddenly.
* In Noah’s time, people had become so evil that God caused a worldwide flood to come over the entire surface of the earth, even covering the mountaintops. Everyone who was not in the boat with Noah drowned. All other floods cover a much smaller land area.
* This term can also be an action, as in “the land was flooded by river water.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Ways to translate the literal meaning of “flood” could include “an overflowing of water” or “large amounts of water.”
* The figurative comparison “like a flood” could keep the literal term, or a substitute term could be used that refers to something that has a flowing aspect to it, such as a river.
* For the expression “like a flood of water” where water is already mentioned, the word “flood” could be translated as “an overwhelming amount” or “an overflowing.”
* This term can be used as a metaphor, as in “do not let the flood sweep over me,” which means “do not let these overwhelming disasters happen to me” or “don’t let me be devastated by disasters” or “don’t let your anger devastate me.” (See: Metaphor)
* The figurative expression “I flood my bed with tears” could be translated as “my tears cover my bed with water like a flood.”

## Footstool (id: 26607)

footstool
=========

Definition:
-----------

The term “footstool” refers to an object which a person puts his feet on, usually to rest them while sitting. This term also has figurative meanings of submission and lower status.

* People in Bible times considered feet to be the least honorable parts of the body. So a “footstool” was of even lower honor because feet were rested on it.
* When God says “I will make my enemies a footstool for my feet” he is declaring power, control, and victory over the people who rebel against him. They will be humbled and conquered to the point of submitting to God’s will.
* To “worship at God’s footstool” means to bow down in worship before him as he sits on his throne. This again communicates humility and submission to God.
* David refers to the temple as God’s “footstool.” This could refer to his absolute authority over his people. This could also be picturing God the King on his throne, with his feet resting on his footstool, which represents all that is in submission to him.

* One type of sexual immorality is adultery, which is sexual activity specifically between a married person and someone who is not that person’s spouse.
* Another type of sexual immorality is “prostitution,” which involves being paid to have sex with someone.
* This term is also used figuratively to refer to Israel’s unfaithfulness to God when they worshiped false gods.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “sexual immorality” could be translated as “immorality” as long as the correct meaning of the term is understood.
* Other ways to translate this term could include “wrong sexual acts” or “sex outside of marriage.”
* This term should be translated in a different way from the term “adultery.”
* The translation of this term’s figurative uses should retain the literal term if possible since there is a common comparison in the Bible between unfaithfulness to God and unfaithfulness in the sexual relationship.

## Free Will Offering (id: 26617)

freewill offering
=================

Definition:
-----------

A freewill offering was a type of sacrifice to God that was not required by the Law of Moses. It was a person’s own choice to give this offering.

* If the freewill offering was an animal to be sacrificed, the animal was permitted to have slight defects since it was a voluntary offering.
* The Israelites ate the sacrificed animal as part of a celebration feast.
* When a freewill offering could be given, this was a cause of rejoicing for Israel since it showed that the harvest had been good so that the people had plenty of food.
* The book of Ezra describes a different type of freewill offering that was brought for rebuilding the temple. This offering consisted of gold and silver money, as well as bowls and other objects made of gold and silver.

## Fruit (id: 26618)

fruit, fruitful, unfruitful
===========================

Definition:
-----------

The term “fruit” refers to the part of a plant that can be eaten. Something that is “fruitful” produces a lot of fruit. Something that is “unfruitful” does not produce fruit.

* In general, the expression “fruit of” refers to anything that comes from or that is produced by something else. For example, the phrase “the fruit of every tree” refers to the fruit that comes from these trees.
* The expression “fruit of the land” refers generally to everything that the land produces for people to eat. This includes not only fruits such as grapes or dates, but also vegetables, nuts, and grains.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* It is best to translate the term “fruit” using the general word for “fruit” that is commonly used in the project language to refer to the edible fruit of a fruit tree. In many languages it may be more natural to use the plural “fruits” whenever it refers to more than one fruit.
* When used literally, the term “fruitful” could be translated as “producing much fruit.”
* The expression “fruit of the land” could also be translated as “food that the land produces” or “food crops that are growing in that region.”
* When used literally, the expression “will be more fruitful” could also be translated as “will produce more fruit.”
