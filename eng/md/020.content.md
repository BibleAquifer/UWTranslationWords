## Sabbath (id: 27044)

Sabbath
=======

Definition:
-----------

The term “Sabbath” refers to the seventh day of the week, which God commanded the Israelites to set apart as a day of rest and doing no work.

* After God finished creating the world in six days, he rested on the seventh day. In the same way, God commanded the Israelites to set aside the seventh day as a special day to rest and worship him.
* The command to “keep the Sabbath holy” is one of the ten commandments that God wrote on the stone tablets that he gave Moses for the Israelites.
* Following the Jewish system of counting days, the Sabbath begins on Friday at sundown and lasts until Saturday at sundown.
* Sometimes in the Bible the Sabbath is called “Sabbath day” rather than only the Sabbath.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This could also be translated as “resting day” or “day for resting” or “day of not working” or “God’s day of rest.”
* Some translations capitalize this term to show that it is a special day, as in “Sabbath Day” or “Resting Day.”
* Consider how this term is translated in a local or national language.

sacrifice, sacrifices, offering
===============================

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the terms “sacrifice” and “offering” refer to special gifts given to God as an act of worshiping him. People also offered sacrifices to false gods.

### sacrifice

* Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God’s perfect sinless Son, can completely cleanse people from sin; animal sacrifices could never do that.

### offering

* Offerings to God were specific things that he commanded the Israelites to give in order to express devotion and obedience to him.
* The names of the different offerings, such as “burnt offering” and “peace offering,” indicated what kind of offering was being given.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* The term “offering” could also be translated as “a gift to God” or “something given to God” or “something valuable that is presented to God.”
* Depending on the context, the term “sacrifice” could also be translated as “something valuable given in worship” or “a special animal killed and presented to God.”
* The action to “sacrifice” could be translated as to “give up something valuable” or to “kill an animal and give it to God.”
* Another way to translate “present yourself as a living sacrifice” could be “as you live your life, offer yourself to God as completely as an animal is offered on an altar.”

## Saint (id: 27048)

saint
=====

Definition:
-----------

The term “saints” literally means “holy ones” and refers to believers in Jesus.

* Later in church history, a person known for his good works was given the title “saint,” but that was not how this term was used during New Testament times.
* Believers in Jesus are saints or holy ones, not because of what they have done, but rather because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ. He is the one who makes them holy.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Ways to translate “saints” could include “holy ones” or “holy people” or “holy believers in Jesus” or “set apart ones.”
* Be careful not to use a term that refers to people of only one Christian group.

## Saltsea (id: 27049)

Salt Sea, Dead Sea
==================

Facts:
------

The Salt Sea (also called the Dead Sea) was located between southern Israel on its west and Moab on its east.

* The Jordan River flows south into the Salt Sea.
* Because it is smaller than most seas, it could be called “Salt Lake.”
* This sea has such a high concentration of minerals (or “salts”) that nothing can live in its waters. Its lack of plants and animals is the cause of the name “Dead Sea.”
* In the Old Testament, this sea is also called the “Sea of Arabah” and the “Sea of Negev” because of its location near the regions of Arabah and Negev.

Savior, savior
==============

Facts:
------

The term “savior” refers to a person who saves or rescues others from danger. It can also refer to someone who gives strength to others or provides for them.

* In the Old Testament, God is referred to as Israel’s Savior because he often rescued them from their enemies, gave them strength, and provided them with what they needed to live.
* In the Old Testament, God appointed judges to protect the Israelites by leading them in battle against other people groups who came to attack them. These judges are sometimes called “saviors.” The Old Testament book of Judges records the time in history when these judges were governing Israel.
* In the New Testament, “Savior” is used as a description or title for Jesus Christ because he saves people from being eternally punished for their sin. He also saves them from being controlled by their sin.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* If possible, “Savior” should be translated with a word that is related to the words “save” and “salvation.”
* Ways to translate this term could include “the One who saves” or “God, who saves” or “who delivers from danger” or “who rescues from enemies” or “Jesus, the one who rescues (people) from sin.”

## Seal (id: 27064)

seal, sealed, unsealed
======================

Definition:
-----------

When referring to an action, the term “seal” means to close an object with something (usually called a “seal”) that makes the object impossible to open without breaking the seal. When referring to an object, the term “seal” refers to something that was made of wood or metal or stone that was formed into a design so that it could be used to stamp something (make an imprint on it).

* A seal was marked with a design to show who it belonged to.
* Seals were used to mark different objects for the purpose of showing that the thing belonged to the owner or had come from the owner or was approved by the owner.
* Seals were used to indicate the authenticity of something as deriving from the owner or being approved by the owner or belonging to the owner in some way.
* Sometimes a seal was put on the top of a ring so that the owner of the ring could press the seal down into something and make an imprint on it.
* Sometimes seals were attached to a string or cord and worn around the neck.
* Melted wax was used to seal letters or other documents that needed to be protected. When the wax cooled and hardened, the letter could not be opened without breaking the wax seal. The person who received the letter would see the unbroken seal and know that no one had opened it.
* A seal was put on the stone in front of Jesus’ grave in order to keep anyone from moving the stone.

## Seed (id: 27066)

seed, semen
===========

Definition:
-----------

A “seed” is the part of a plant that gets planted in the ground to reproduce more of the same kind of plant. However, in the Bible the term “seed” is used figuratively to mean several different things.

* The term “seed” is used figuratively and euphemistically to refer to the tiny cells inside a man that combine with cells of a woman to cause a baby to grow inside her. A collection of these cells is called “semen.”
* Related to this, “seed” is also used to refer to a person’s offspring or descendants.
* This word often has a plural meaning, referring to more than one seed grain or more than one descendant.
* In the parable of the farmer planting seeds, Jesus compared his seeds to the Word of God, which is planted in people’s hearts in order to produce good spiritual fruit.
* The apostle Paul also uses the term “seed” to refer to the Word of God.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* For a literal seed, it is best to use the literal term for “seed” that is used in the target language for what a farmer plants in his field.
* The literal term should also be used in contexts where it refers figuratively to God’s Word.
* For the figurative use that refers to people who are of the same family line, it may be more clear to use the word “descendant” or “descendants” instead of “seed.” Some languages may have a word that means “children and grandchildren.”
* For a man or woman’s “seed,” consider how the target expresses this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people. (See: euphemism)

## Servant (id: 27075)

servant, serve, maidservant, young man, young women
===================================================

Definition:
-----------

A “servant” refers to a person who works for (or obeys) another person, either by choice or by force. A servant was under his master's direction. In the Bible, “servant” and “slave” are mostly interchangable terms. The term “serve” generally means to do work for someone, and the concept can be applied in a wide variety of contexts.

* In the Bible the words “young man” or “young woman” often mean “servant” or “slave.” This meaning will be discerned from context. One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” which could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.
* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”
* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often called his “servants.”
* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”
* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”
* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”
* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.
* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.
* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”
* Often, when a person referred to himself as “your servant” he was showing respect to the person addressed. That person may have had higher social status, or the speaker may be showing humility. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.

## Shaddai (id: 27077)

shaddai
=======

Facts:
------

The term “Shaddai” is a Hebrew word used for deity. It is used in the Old Testament as a personal name for God. The specific origin (and therefore meaning) of this term is not known. Scholars have proposed different possibilites for what it means and the most probable is that “shaddai” means “mountain” or “mountain range.”

* The Hebrew word “Shaddai” is often translated into English as “the Almighty.”
* The Hebrew phrase “El Shaddai” is often translated into English as “God Almighty.”
* If “Shaddai” means “mountain” or “mountain range” then the Hebrew phrase "El Shaddai" literally means “God, the one of the mountain.”
* The ULT and UST texts always translate this term as, “Shaddai,” in agreement with the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Even though the word Shaddai is a name for a God it is often translated as a title or description, “the Almighty,” rather than as a name. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to translate the word in the same way that it does. If a translation does not exist, you may wish to use the name Shaddai.
* If you choose to translate the term “Shaddai” as a name you could spell it the way it sounds in your language and you could also spell the phrase “El Shaddai” the way it sounds in your language.

## Shame (id: 27078)

shame, ashamed, disgrace, humiliate, reproach
=============================================

Definition:
-----------

The term “shame” refers to the painful feeling of being disgraced or humiliated that a person feels when they do something that others consider dishonorable or improper.

* Something that is “shameful” is “improper” or “dishonorable.”
* The term “ashamed” describes how a person feels when he has done something improper or dishonorable.
* The term “humiliate” means to cause someone to feel shamed or disgraced, usually publicly. The act of shaming someone is called “humiliation.”
* To “reproach” someone means to criticize or disapprove of that person’s character or behavior.
* The phrase “put to shame” means to defeat people or expose their actions so that they feel ashamed of themselves. The prophet Isaiah said that those who make and worship idols will be put to shame.
* The term “disgraceful” can be used to describe a sinful act or the person who did it. When a person does something sinful, it can cause him to be in a state of disgrace or dishonor.
* Sometimes a person who is doing good things is treated in a way that causes him disgrace or shame. For example, when Jesus was killed on a cross, this was a disgraceful way to die. Jesus had done nothing wrong to deserve this disgrace.
* When God humbles someone, it means that he is causing a prideful person to experience failure to help him overcome his pride. This is different from humiliating someone, which is often done in order to hurt that person.
* Saying that a person is “above reproach” or “beyond reproach” or “without reproach” means that this person behaves in a God\-honoring way and there is little or nothing that could be said in criticism of him.

## Siege (id: 27091)

siege, besiege, besieged, siegeworks
====================================

Definition:
-----------

A “siege” occurs when an attacking army surrounds a city and keeps it from receiving any supplies of food and water. To “besiege” a city or to put it “under siege” means to attack it by means of a siege.

* When the Babylonians came to attack Israel, they used the tactic of a siege against Jerusalem to weaken the people inside the city.
* Often during a siege, ramps of dirt are gradually constructed to enable the attacking army to cross over the city walls and invade the city.
* To “besiege” a city can also be expressed as to “lay siege” to it or to “perform a siege” on it.
* The term “besieged” has the same meaning as the expression “under siege.” Both these expressions describe a city that an enemy army is surrounding and besieging.

sign, proof, reminder
=====================

The term “sign” usually refers an object, event, or action that communicates a special meaning.

* In the Bible, signs are sometimes given in connection to a promise or covenant that God has made:

    + The book of Genesis describes the rainbow God created in the sky as a sign (or reminder) to himself that he has promised he will never again destroy all life with a worldwide flood.
        + In the book of Genesis, God commanded the Israelites to circumcise their sons as a sign (or indicator) of the fact that he had made his covenant with them.

    + The book of Luke describes that an angel gave shepherds a sign that would help them know which baby in Bethlehem was the newborn Messiah.
        + Judas kissed Jesus as a sign to the religious leaders that Jesus was the one they should arrest.
* Signs can prove that something is true:

        + The book of Acts describes the miracles performed by the prophets and apostles as signs that proved they were speaking God’s message.
        + The book of John describes the miracles that Jesus performed as signs that proved he was truly the Messiah.

## Sin (id: 27098)

sin, sinful, sinner, sinning
============================

Definition:
-----------

The term “sin” refers to actions, thoughts, and words that are against God’s will and laws. Sin can also refer to not doing something that God wants us to do.

* Sin includes anything we do that does not obey or please God, even things that other people don’t know about.
* Thoughts and actions that disobey God’s will are called “sinful.”
* Because Adam sinned, all human beings are born with a “sinful nature,” a nature that that controls them and causes them to sin.
* A “sinner” is someone who sins, so every human being is a sinner.
* Sometimes the word “sinners” was used by religious people like the Pharisees to refer to people who didn’t keep the law as well as the Pharisees thought they should.
* The term “sinner” was also used for people who were considered to be worse sinners than other people. For example, this label was given to tax collectors and prostitutes.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “sin” could be translated with a word or phrase that means “disobedience to God” or “going against God’s will” or “evil behavior and thoughts” or “wrongdoing.”
* To “sin” could also be translated as to “disobey God” or to “do wrong.”
* Depending on the context “sinful” could be translated as “full of wrongdoing” or “wicked” or “immoral” or “evil” or “rebelling against God.”
* Depending on the context the term “sinner” could be translated with a word or phrase that means “person who sins” or “person who does wrong things” or “person who disobeys God” or “person who disobeys the law.”
* The term “sinners” could be translated by a word or phrase that means “very sinful people” or “people considered to be very sinful” or “immoral people.”
* Ways to translate “tax collectors and sinners” could include “people who collect money for the government, and other very sinful people” or “very sinful people, including (even) tax collectors.”
* Make sure the translation of this term can include sinful behavior and thoughts, even those that other people don’t see or know about.
* The term “sin” should be general, and different from the terms for “wickedness” and “evil.”

## Sin Offering (id: 27100)

sin offering, purification offering
===================================

Definition:
-----------

The “sin offering” was one of several sacrifices that God required the Israelites to offer.

* This offering involved sacrificing a bull, burning its blood and fat on the altar, and taking the rest of the animal’s body and burning it on the ground outside the Israelite camp.
* The complete burning up of this animal sacrifice shows how holy God is and how terrible sin is.
* The Bible teaches that in order for there to be a cleansing from sin, blood must be shed to pay the cost for the sin that was committed.
* Animal sacrifices could not permanently bring about forgiveness of sin.
* Jesus’ death on the cross paid the penalty for sin, for all time. He was the perfect sin offering.

## Sinai (id: 27099)

Sinai, Horeb
============

Facts:
------

Mount Sinai, also called Mount Horeb, is a mountain that was probably located in the southern part of what is now called the Sinai Peninsula, but the exact location of this mountain is not known.

* It is the place where God revealed his covenant to the Israelites and gave Moses the stone tablets on which he had written the ten commandments.
* It is also called the “mountain of God.”
* It was also the place where God later told Moses to strike a rock to provide water for the Israelites as they were wandering in the desert.
* It was the place where Moses saw the burning bush when he was tending sheep.

## Snare (id: 27104)

snare, ensnare, entrap, trap, trapped, pitfall
==============================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “snare” and “trap” refer to devices that are used to catch animals and keep them from escaping. To “snare” or “ensnare” is to catch with a snare, and to “trap” or “entrap” is to catch with a trap. In the Bible, these terms were also used figuratively to talk about how sin and temptation are like hidden traps that catch people and harm them.

* A “snare” is a loop of rope or wire that suddenly pulls tight when an animal steps into it, ensnaring its leg.
* A “trap” is usually made of metal or wood and has two parts that suddenly and powerfully close together, catching an animal so it can’t get away. Sometimes a trap can be a deep hole that has been made in order to get something to fall into it.
* Usually the snare or trap is hidden so that its prey is taken by surprise.
* The phrase “set a trap” means to get a trap ready to capture something.
* To “fall into a trap” refers to falling into a deep hole or pit that was dug and hidden in order to catch an animal.
* A person who is starts sinning and cannot stop can be described as “ensnared by sin” in a figurative reference to the way an animal can be ensnared and cannot escape.
* Just as an animal is endangered and hurt by being in a trap, so a person caught in the trap of sin is being harmed by that sin and needs to be set free.

## Snow (id: 27105)

snow
====

Facts:
------

The term “snow” refers to white flakes of frozen water that can fall from clouds in places where the air temperature is cold.

* Snow falls in places of higher elevation in Israel, but does not always stay on the ground very long before melting. The peaks of mountains tend to have snow that lasts longer. One example of a place mentioned in the Bible as having snow is Mount Lebanon.
* Something that is very white often has its color compared to the color of snow. For example, in the book of Revelation Jesus’ clothing and hair were described as being “white as snow.”
* The whiteness of snow also symbolizes purity and cleanliness. For example, the statement that our “sins will be as white as snow” means that God will completely cleanse his people from their sins.
* Some languages might refer to snow as “frozen rain” or “flakes of ice” or “frozen flakes.”
* “Snow water” refers to the water that comes from melted snow.

## Solomon (id: 27107)

Solomon
=======

Facts:
------

Solomon was one of King David’s sons. His mother was Bathsheba.

* When Solomon became king, God told him to ask for anything he wanted. So Solomon asked for wisdom to rule the people justly and well. God was pleased with Solomon’s request and gave him both wisdom and much wealth.
* Solomon is also well known for having a magnificent temple built in Jerusalem.
* Although Solomon ruled wisely in the first years of his reign, later on he foolishly married many foreign women and started worshiping their gods.
* Because of Solomon’s unfaithfulness, after his death God divided the Israelites into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah. These kingdoms often fought against each other.

## Son of God (id: 27108)

Son of God, the Son
===================

Facts:
------

The term “Son of God” refers to Jesus, the Word of God, who came into the world as a human being. He is also often referred to as “the Son.”

* The Son of God has the same nature as God the Father, and is fully God.
* God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are all of one essence.
* Unlike human sons, the Son of God has always existed.
* In the beginning, the Son of God was active in creating the world, along with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* For the term “Son of God,” it is best to translate “Son” with the same word the language would naturally use to refer to a human son.
* Make sure the word used to translate “son” fits with the word used to translate “father” and that these words are the most natural ones used to express a true father\-son relationship in the project language.
* Using a capital letter to begin “Son” may help show that this is talking about God.
* The phrase “the Son” is a shortened form of “the Son of God,” especially when it occurs in the same context as “the Father.”

## Son of Man (id: 27109)

Son of Man, son of man
======================

Definition:
-----------

The title “Son of Man” was used by Jesus to refer to himself. He often used this term instead of saying “I” or “me.”

* In the Bible, “son of man” could be a way of referring to or addressing a man. It could also mean “human being.”
* Throughout the Old Testament book of Ezekiel, God frequently addressed Ezekiel as “son of man.” For example he said, “You, son of man, must prophesy.”
* The prophet Daniel saw a vision of a “son of man” coming with the clouds, which is a reference to the coming Messiah.
* Jesus also said that the Son of Man will be coming back someday on the clouds.
* These references to the Son of Man coming on the clouds reveal that Jesus the Messiah is God.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* When Jesus uses the term “Son of Man” it could be translated as “the One who became a human being” or “the Man from heaven.”
* Some translators occasionally include “I” or “me” with this title (as in “I, the Son of Man”) to make it clear that Jesus was talking about himself.
* Check to make sure that the translation of this term does not give a wrong meaning (such as referring to an illegitimate son or giving the wrong impression that Jesus was only a human being).
* When used to refer to a person, “son of man” could also be translated as “you, a human being” or “you, man” or “human being” or “man.”

sons of God, children of God
============================

* This use of the term speaks of a relationship with God that is like the relationship between a human son and his father, with all the privileges associated with being sons.
* Some people interpret the term “sons of God” that appears in Genesis 6 to mean fallen angels—evil spirits or demons. Others think it may refer to powerful political rulers or to the descendants of Seth.
* The title “Son of God” is a different term: it refers to Jesus, who is God’s only Son.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

## Sorcery (id: 27111)

sorcerer, sorceress, sorcery, sorceries, witchcraft, magician
=============================================================

Definition:
-----------

“Sorcery” or “witchcraft” refers to using magic, which involves doing powerful things through the help of evil spirits. A “sorcerer” is someone who does these powerful, magical things.

* The use of magic and sorcery can involve both beneficial things (such as healing someone) and harmful things (such as putting a curse on someone). But all kinds of sorcery are wrong, because they use the power of evil spirits.
* In the Bible, God says that the use of sorcery is as evil as other terrible sins (such as adultery, worshiping idols, and child sacrifice).
* The terms “sorcery” and “witchcraft” could also be translated as “evil spirit power” or “casting spells.”
* Possible ways to translated “sorcerer” could include “worker of magic” or “person who casts spells” or “person who does miracles using evil spirit power.”
* Note that “sorcery” has a different meaning than the term “divination,” which refers to attempting to contact the spirit world.

-----------

The term “soul” can either refer generally to the non\-physical part of a person or refer specifically to a person’s awareness of themselves as a person distinct from others.

* In the Bible, the terms “soul” and “spirit” may be two different concepts, or they may be two terms that refer to the same concept.
* When a person dies, his soul leaves his body.
* In contrast to the body, the “soul” can be spoken of as the part of a person that “relates to God.”
* The word “soul” is sometimes used figuratively to refer to the whole person. For example, “the soul who sins” means “the person who sins” and “my soul is tired” means “I am tired.”

Translation Suggestions:

* The term “soul” could also be translated as “inner self” or “inner person.”
* In some contexts, “my soul” could be translated as “I” or “me.”
* Usually the phrase “the soul” can be translated as “the person” or “he” or “him,” depending on the context.
* Some languages might only have one word for the concepts “soul” and “spirit.”
* In Hebrews 4:12, the figurative phrase “dividing soul and spirit” could mean “deeply discerning or exposing the inner person.”

## Sow (id: 27113)

sow, sower, plant, planted, replanted, transplanted
===================================================

Definition:
-----------

To “sow” means to put seeds on top of or in the ground in order to grow plants. A “sower” is a person who sows or plants seeds. A “plant” is generally something that grows and is attached to the ground.

* One method of sowing or planting seeds during biblical times was to take handfuls of seeds and scatter them on the ground.
* Farmers would often plow the ground on which they had sown seeds after they had sown the seeds. The reason farmers would plow the ground after they had sown the seed is so that the seed would be covered with soil.
* Sometimes farmers may have plowed the field that they sowed seeds in both before and after sowing seeds.

Translations Suggestions
------------------------

* The term to “sow” could also be translated as to “plant.” Make sure the word or phrase you use to translate this term refers to, or can include, planting seeds by scattering them because this is the method of sowing that Jesus was referring to in his parable in Matthew 13:3–23, Mark 4:2–20, and Luke 8:4–8 where he describes a sower who sowed seeds.
* Other ways to translate “sower” could include “planter” or “farmer” or “person who plants seeds.”
* In English, “sow” is only used for planting seeds, but the English word “plant” can be used for planting seeds as well as larger things, such as trees. Other languages may also use different words, depending on what is being planted.

## Stronghold (id: 27124)

stronghold, fortifications, fortress, citadel
=============================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “stronghold” and “fortress” both refer to places that are well protected against an attack by enemy soldiers. A “citadel” is a fortress inside a city. The term “fortified” describes a city or other place that has been made safe from attack.

* Often, strongholds and fortresses were manmade structures with defensive walls. They could also have been places with natural protective barriers such as rocky cliffs or high mountains.
* People fortified strongholds by building thick walls or other structures that made it difficult for an enemy to break through.
* “Stronghold” or “fortress” could be translated as “securely strong place” or “strongly protected place.”
* The term “fortified city” could be translated as “securely protected city” or “strongly built city.”
* Another figurative meaning for the term “stronghold” referred to something that someone wrongly trusted in for security, such as a false god or other thing that was worshiped instead of Yahweh. This could be translated as “false strongholds.”
* This term should be translated differently from “refuge,” which emphasizes safety more than the concept of being fortified.

## Sword (id: 27133)

sword, swordsmen
================

Definition:
-----------

A sword is a flat\-bladed metal weapon used to cut or stab. It has a handle and a long, pointed blade with a very sharp cutting edge.

* In ancient times the length of a sword’s blade was about 60 to 91 centimeters.
* Some swords have two sharp edges and are called “double\-edged” or “two\-edged” swords.
* Jesus’ disciples had swords for self defense. With his sword, Peter cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant.
* Both John the Baptist and the apostle James were beheaded with swords.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* A sword is used as a metaphor for God’s word. God’s teachings in the Bible exposed people’s innermost thoughts and convicted them of their sin. In a similar way, a sword cuts deeply, causing pain. (See: Metaphor)
* One way to translate this figurative use would be, “God’s word is like a sword, which cuts deeply and exposes sin.”
* Another figurative use of this term occurred in the book of Psalms, where the tongue or speech of a person was compared to a sword, which can injure people. This could be translated as “the tongue is like a sword that can badly injure someone.”
* If swords are not known in your culture, this word could be translated with the name of another long\-bladed weapon that is used to cut or stab.
* A sword could also be described as a “sharp weapon” or “long knife.” Some translations could include a picture of a sword.

## Synagogue (id: 27134)

synagogue
=========

Definition:
-----------

A synagogue is a building where Jewish people meet together to worship God.

* Since ancient times, a synagogue’s services have included times of prayer, scripture reading, and teaching about the scriptures.
* The Jews originally started building synagogues as places to pray and worship God in their own cities, because many of them lived far away from the temple in Jerusalem.
* Jesus often taught in synagogues and healed people there.
* The word “synagogue” can be used figuratively to refer to the group of people meeting there.
