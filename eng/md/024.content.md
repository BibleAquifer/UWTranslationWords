## Warrior (id: 27198)

soldier, warrior
================

Facts:
------

The terms “warrior” and “soldier” both can refer to someone who fights in an army. But there are also some differences.

* Usually the term “warrior” is a general, broad term to refer to a man who is gifted and courageous in battle.
* Yahweh is figuratively described as a “warrior.”
* The term “soldier” more specifically refers to someone who belongs to a certain army or who is fighting in a certain battle.
* Roman soldiers in Jerusalem were there to keep order and to carry out duties such as executing prisoners. They guarded Jesus before crucifying him and some were ordered to stand guard at his tomb.
* The translator should consider whether there are two words in the project language for “warrior” and “soldier” that also differ in meaning and use.

watchtower, tower
=================

Definition:

## Well (id: 27202)

cistern, well
=============

Definition:
-----------

The terms “well” and “cistern” refer to two different kinds of sources for water in Bible times.

* A well is a deep hole dug into the ground so that underground water can flow into it.
* A cistern is a deep hole dug into rock that was used as a holding tank for collecting rain water.
* Cisterns were usually dug into rock and sealed with plaster to keep the water in. A “broken cistern” happened when the plaster became cracked so that the water leaked out.
* Cisterns were often located in the courtyard area of people’s homes to catch the rainwater that would run off the roof.
* Wells were often located where they could be accessed by several families or a whole community.
* Because water was very important for both people and livestock, the right to use a well was often a cause of strife and conflict.
* Both wells and cisterns were usually covered with a large stone to prevent anything falling in it. Often there was a rope with a bucket or pot attached to it to bring the water up to the surface.
* Sometimes a dry cistern was used as a place to imprison someone, such as happened to Joseph and Jeremiah.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Ways to translate “well” could include “deep water hole” or “deep hole for spring water” or “deep hole for drawing water.”
* The term “cistern” could be translated as “stone water pit” or “deep and narrow pit for water” or “underground tank for holding water.”
* These terms are similar in meaning. The main difference is that a well continually receives water from underground springs, whereas a cistern is a holding tank for water that usually comes from rain.

## Wheat (id: 27203)

wheat
=====

Definition:
-----------

Wheat is a type of grain that people grow for food. When the Bible mentions “grain” or “seeds,” it is often talking about wheat grain or seeds.

* The wheat seeds or grains grow at the top of the wheat plant.
* After harvesting the wheat, the grain is separated from the stalk of the plant by threshing it. The stalk of the wheat plant is also called “straw” and is often placed on the ground for animals to sleep on.
* After threshing, the chaff surrounding the grain seed is separated from the grain by winnowing and is thrown away.
* People grind the wheat grain into flour, and use this for making bread.

## Wine (id: 27205)

wine, wineskin, new wine
========================

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “wine” refers to a kind of fermented drink made from the juice of a fruit called grapes. Wine was stored in “wineskins,” which were containers made out of animal skin.

* The term “new wine” referred to grape juice that had just been taken from the grape and was not fermented yet. Sometimes the term “wine” also referred to unfermented grape juice.
* To make wine, grapes are crushed in a winepress so that the juice comes out. The juice eventually ferments and alcohol forms in it.
* In Bible times, wine was the normal drink with meals. It did not have as much alcohol as present\-day wine has.
* Before wine was served for a meal, it was often mixed with water.
* A wineskin that was old and brittle would get cracks in it, which allowed the wine to leak out. New wineskins were soft and flexible, which meant they did not tear easily and could store the wine safely.
* If wine is unknown in your culture, it could be translated as “fermented grape juice” or “fermented drink made from a fruit called grapes” or “fermented fruit juice.” (See: How to Translate Unknowns)
* Ways to translate “wineskin” could include “bag for wine” or “animal skin wine bag” or “animal skin container for wine.”

## Wine Press (id: 27206)

winepress
=========

Definition:
-----------

During Bible times, a “winepress” was a large container or open place where the juice of grapes was extracted in order to make wine.

* In Israel, winepresses were usually large, wide basins that were dug out of solid rock. Clusters of grapes were put on the flat bottom of the hole and people trampled the grapes with their feet to get the grape juice to flow out.
* Usually a winepress had two levels, with the grapes being trampled in the top level so that the juice would run down into the lower level where it could be collected.
* The term “winepress” is also used figuratively in the Bible as a picture of God’s wrath being poured out on wicked people. (See: Metaphor)

## Winnow (id: 27207)

winnow, sift
============

Definition:
-----------

The terms “winnow” and “sift” mean to separate grain from unwanted materials. In the Bible, both words can also be used to refer to separating or dividing people.

* To “winnow” means to separate grain from the unwanted parts of the plant by tossing both the grain and chaff into the air, allowing the wind to blow the chaff away.
* The word “sift” refers to shaking the winnowed grain in a sieve to get rid of any remaining unwanted materials, such as dirt or stones.
* In the Old Testament, “winnow” and “sift” are used figuratively to describe hardship that separates the righteous people from the unrighteous people.
* Jesus also used the term “sift” in this figurative way when he was telling Simon Peter about how he and the other disciples would be tested in their faith.
* To translate these terms, use the words or phrases in the project language that refer to these activities; possible translations might be “shaking” or “fanning.” If winnowing or sifting are not known, then these terms could be translated by a term that refers to a different method of separating grain from chaff or dirt, or by describing this process.

## Wise Men (id: 27209)

wise men, advisor
=================

Definition:
-----------

The term “wise men” simply means people who are wise. In the Bible, however, the term “wise men” often refers to men with unusual knowledge and abilities who served in a king’s royal court as advisors to the king or other high officials.

### Old Testament

* Sometimes the term “wise men” is explained in the text as “prudent men” or “men with understanding.” This refers to men who act wisely and righteously because they obey God.
* The “wise men” who served pharaohs or other kings were often scholars who studied the stars, especially looking for special meanings for the patterns that the stars made in their positions in the sky. Sometimes “wise men” also practiced divination of performed acts of magic, probably by the power of evil spirits.
* Often wise men were expected to explain the meanings of dreams. For example, King Nebuchadnezzar demanded that his wise men describe his dreams and tell him what they meant, but none of them was able to do this, except Daniel who had received this knowledge from God.

### New Testament

* The group of men who came from eastern regions to worship Jesus were called “magi,” which is often translated as “wise men,” since this probably refers to scholars who served a ruler of an eastern country.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, the term “wise men” could be translated using the term “wise” or with a phrase such as “gifted men” or “educated men” or some other term that refers to men who have an important job working for a ruler.
* When the term “wise men” simply means people who are wise, the word “wise” should be translated in the same or similar way to how it is translated elsewhere in the Bible.

## Wolf (id: 27211)

wolf, wild dogs
===============

Definition:
-----------

A wolf is a fierce, meat\-eating animal that is similar to a wild dog.

* Wolves usually hunt in groups and stalk their prey in a clever and stealthy manner.
* In the Bible, the term “wolves” is used figuratively to refer to false teachers or false prophets who destroy believers, who are compared to sheep. False teaching causes people to believe wrong things that bring harm to them.
* This comparison is based on the fact that sheep are especially vulnerable to being attacked and eaten by wolves, because they are weak and cannot defend themselves.

Translation Suggestion
----------------------

* This term could be translated as “wild dog” or “wild animal.”
* Other names for wild dogs could be “jackal” or “coyote.”
* When used figuratively to refer to people, this could be translated as “evil people who harm people like animals that attack sheep.”

## Word of God (id: 27213)

word of God, word of Yahweh, word of the Lord, word of truth, scripture
=======================================================================

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, the term “word of God” refers to anything that God has communicated to people. This includes spoken and written messages. Jesus is also called “the Word of God.”

* The term “scriptures” means “writings.” It is only used in the New Testament and refers to the Hebrew scriptures, which is the Old Testament. These writings were God’s message that he had told people to write down so that many years in the future people could still read it.
* The related terms “word of Yahweh” and “word of the Lord” often refer to a specific message from God that was given to a prophet or other person in the Bible.
* Sometimes this term occurs as simply “the word” or “my word” or “your word” (when talking about God’s word).
* In the New Testament, Jesus is called “the Word” and “the Word of God.” These titles mean that Jesus fully reveals who God is, because he is God himself.

The term “word of truth” is another way of referring to “God’s word,” which is his message or teaching. It does not refer to just one word.

* God’s word of truth includes everything that God has taught people about himself, his creation, and his plan of salvation through Jesus.
* This term emphasizes the fact that what God has told us is true, faithful, and real.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, other ways to translate this term could include “the message of Yahweh” or “God’s message” or “the teachings from God.”
* It may be more natural in some languages to make this term plural and say “God’s words” or “the words of Yahweh.”
* The expression “the word of Yahweh came” is often used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. This could be translated as “Yahweh spoke this message” or “Yahweh spoke these words.”
* The term “scripture” or “scriptures” could be translated as “the writings” or “the written message from God.” This term should be translated differently from the translation of the term “word.”
* When “word” occurs alone and it refers to God’s word, it could be translated as “the message” or “God’s word” or “the teachings.” Also consider the alternate translations suggested above.
* When the Bible refers to Jesus as “the Word,” this term could be translated as “the Message” or “the Truth.”
* “Word of truth” could be translated as “God’s true message” or “God’s word, which is true.”
* It is important for the translation of this term to include the meaning of being true.

## World (id: 27214)

world, worldly
==============

Definition:
-----------

The term “world” usually refers to the part of the universe where people live: the earth. The term “worldly” describes the evil values and behaviors of people living in this world.

* In its most general sense, the term “world” refers to the heavens and the earth, as well as everything in them.
* In many contexts, “world” actually means “people in the world.”
* Sometimes it is implied that this refers to the evil people on earth or the people who do not obey God.
* The apostles also used “world” to refer to the selfish behaviors and corrupt values of the people living in this world. This can include self\-righteous religious practices which are based on human efforts.
* People and things characterized by these values are said to be “worldly.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, “world” could also be translated as “universe” or “people of this world” or “corrupt things in the world” or “evil attitudes of people in the world.”
* The phrase “all the world” often means “many people” and refers to the people living in a certain region. For example, “all the world came to Egypt” could be translated as “many people from the surrounding countries came to Egypt” or “people from all the countries surrounding Egypt came there.”
* Another way to translate “all the world went to their hometown to be registered in the Roman census” would be “many of the people living in regions ruled by the Roman empire went…”
* Depending on the context, the term “worldly” could be translated as “evil” or “sinful” or “selfish” or “ungodly” or “corrupt” or “influenced by the corrupt values of people in this world.”
* The phrase “saying these things in the world” can be translated as “saying these things to the people of the world.”
* In other contexts, “in the world” could also be translated as “living among the people of the world” or “living among ungodly people.”
