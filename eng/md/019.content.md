For this reason many English translations have chosen to transliterate the original language (Hebrew) word as “Rephaites” or “Rephaim.” You may desire to do the same thing in your translation.
* In Job 26:5, Psalm 88:10, Proverbs 2:18, Proverbs 9:18, Proverbs 21:16, Isaiah 14:9, Isaiah 26:14, and Isaiah 26:19 the term “Raphaites” refers to people who are dead or to their “spirits.”
* In all other occurrences in the Old Testament the term “Raphaites” refers to the people group who were human beings who were alive and made up a specific people group.
* The people group the Ammonites called the Raphaites by the name “Zamzummites” (See Deuteronomy 2:20\).

## Redeem (id: 27019)

redeem, redeemer, redemption
============================

Definition:
-----------

The term “redeem” refers to buying back something or someone that has been previously owned or held captive. A “redeemer” is someone who redeems something or someone.

* God gave laws to the Israelites about how to redeem people or things. For example, someone could redeem a person who was in slavery by paying the price so that the slave could go free. The word “ransom” also refers to this practice.
* If someone’s land had been sold, a relative of that person could “redeem” or “buy back” that land so that it would stay in the family.
* These practices show how God redeems people who are in slavery to sin. When he died on the cross, Jesus paid the full price for people’s sins and redeemed all those who trust in him for salvation. People who have been redeemed by God are set free from sin and its punishment.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, the term “redeem” could also be translated as “buy back” or “pay to free (someone)” or “ransom.”
* The term “redemption” could be translated as “ransom” or “freedom payment” or “buying back.”
* The words “ransom” and “redeem” have basically the same meaning, so some languages may have only one term to translate both these words. The word “ransom,” however, can also mean the payment necessary to “redeem” something or someone. The term “redeem” never refers to the actual payment itself.

## Reward (id: 27034)

reward, prize, deserve
======================

Definition:
-----------

The term “reward” refers to what a person receives because of something he has done, either good or bad. To “reward” someone is to give someone something he deserves. However, this is different than the concept of “wages,” which refers to payment (often money) given in exchange for work performed.

* A reward can be a good or positive thing that a person receives because he has done something well or because he has obeyed God.
* Sometimes a reward can refer to negative things that may result from bad behavior, such as the statement “the reward of the wicked.” In this context “reward” refers to the punishment or negative consequences they receive because of their sinful actions.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, the term “reward” could be translated as “payment” or “something that is deserved” or “punishment.”
* To “reward” someone could be translated by to “repay” or to “punish” or to “give what is deserved.”
* Make sure the translation of this term does not refer to wages. A reward is not specifically about earning money as part of a job.

## Righteous (id: 27035)

righteous, righteousness, unrighteous, unrighteousness, upright, uprightness
============================================================================

Definition:
-----------

The term “righteousness” refers to God’s absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love. Having these qualities makes God “righteous.” Because God is righteous, he must condemn sin.

* These terms are also often used to describe a person who obeys God and is morally good. However, because all people have sinned, no one except God is completely righteous.
* Examples of people the Bible who were called “righteous” include Noah, Job, Abraham, Zachariah, and Elisabeth.
* When people trust in Jesus to save them, God cleanses them from their sins and declares them to be righteous because of Jesus’ righteousness.

The term “unrighteous” means to be sinful and morally corrupt. “Unrighteousness” refers to sin or the condition of being sinful.

* These terms especially refer to living in a way that disobeys God’s teachings and commands.
* Unrighteous people are immoral in their thoughts and actions.
* Sometimes “the unrighteous” refers specifically to people who do not believe in Jesus.

The terms “upright” and “uprightness” refer to acting in a way that follows God’s laws.

* The meaning of these words includes the idea of standing up straight and looking directly ahead.
* A person who is “upright” is someone who obeys God’s rules and does not do things that are against his will.
* Terms such as “integrity” and “righteous” have similar meanings and are sometimes used in parallelism constructions, such as “integrity and uprightness.” (See: parallelism)

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* When it describes God, the term “righteous” could be translated as “perfectly good and just” or “always acting rightly.”
* God’s “righteousness” could also be translated as “perfect faithfulness and goodness.”
* When it describes people who are obedient to God, the term “righteous” could also be translated as “morally good” or “just” or “living a God\-pleasing life.”
* The phrase “the righteous” could also be translated as “righteous people” or “God\-fearing people.”
* Depending on the context, “righteousness” could also be translated with a word or phrase that means “goodness” or “being perfect before God” or “acting in a right way by obeying God” or “doing perfectly good.”
* The term “unrighteous” could simply be translated as “not righteous.”
* Depending on the context, other ways to translate this could include “wicked” or “immoral” or “people who rebel against God” or “sinful.”
* The phrase “the unrighteous” could be translated as “unrighteous people.”
* The term “unrighteousness” could be translated as “sin” or “evil thoughts and actions” or “wickedness.”
* If possible, it is best to translate this in a way that shows its relationship to “righteous, righteousness.”
* Ways to translate “upright” could include “acting rightly” or “one who acts rightly” or “following God’s laws” or “obedient to God” or “behaving in a way that is right.”
* The term “uprightness” could be translated as “moral purity” or “good moral conduct” or “rightness.”
* The phrase “the upright” could be translated as “people who are upright” or “upright people.”
