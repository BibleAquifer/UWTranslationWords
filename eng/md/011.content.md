## Jacob (id: 26739)

Jacob, Israel
=============

Facts:
------

Jacob was the younger twin son of Isaac by Rebekah. God changed his name to “Israel.” His descendants became the nation of Israel.

* Jacob is the last of the three patriarchs of the Israelite nation: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The descendants of Jacob’s twelve sons because the twelve tribes of Israel.
* The name Jacob is similar to the Hebrew word meaning “heel.” As Jacob was being born, he was holding onto the heel of his twin brother Esau. In the Old Testament times, the heel was a body part associated both with attack and with the rear part of a person’s body. The Hebrew name Jacob was probably associated with the idea of attacking someone from behind.
* Many years later, God changed Jacob’s name to “Israel,” which probably means “He struggles with God.”
* Jacob married Laban’s two daughters, Leah and Rachel, as well as each of their servants, Zilpah and Bilhah. These four women mothered the twelve sons who became the ancestral fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel.
* In the New Testament, a different man named Jacob is listed as being Joseph’s father in Matthew’s genealogy.

## Jesus (id: 26758)

Jesus, Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus
=================================

Facts:
------

Jesus is God’s Son. The name “Jesus” means “Yahweh saves.” The term “Christ” is a title that means “anointed one” and is another word for Messiah.

* The two names are often combined as “Jesus Christ” or “Christ Jesus.” These names emphasize that God’s Son is the Messiah, who came to save people from being punished eternally for their sins.
* In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to be born as a human being. His mother was told by an angel to call him “Jesus” because he was destined to save people from their sins.
* Jesus did many miracles that revealed that he is God and that he is the Christ, or the Messiah.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* In many languages “Jesus” and “Christ” are spelled in a way that keeps the sounds or spelling as close to the original as possible. For example, “Jesucristo,” “Jezus Christus,” “Yesus Kristus”, and “Hesukristo” are some of the ways that these names are translated into different languages.
* For the term “Christ,” some translators may prefer to use only some form of the term “Messiah” throughout.
* Also consider how these names are spelled in a nearby local or national language.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

* **22:4** The angel said, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him **Jesus** and he will be the Messiah.”
* **23:2** “Name him **Jesus** (which means, ‘Yahweh saves’), because he will save the people from their sins.”
* **24:7** So John baptized him (Jesus), even though **Jesus** had never sinned.
* **24:9** There is only one God. But John heard God the Father speak, and saw **Jesus** the Son and the Holy Spirit when he baptized **Jesus**.
* **25:8** **Jesus** did not give in to Satan’s temptations, so Satan left him.
* **26:8** Then **Jesus** went throughout the region of Galilee, and large crowds came to him. They brought many people who were sick or handicapped, including those who could not see, walk, hear, or speak, and **Jesus** healed them.
* **31:3** Then **Jesus** finished praying and went to the disciples. He walked on top of the water across the lake toward their boat!
* **38:2** He (Judas) knew that the Jewish leaders denied that **Jesus** was the Messiah and that they were plotting to kill him.
* **40:8** Through his death, **Jesus** opened a way for people to come to God.
* **42:11** Then **Jesus** was taken up to heaven, and a cloud hid him from their sight. **Jesus** sat down at the right hand of God to rule over all things.
* **50:17** **Jesus** and his people will live on the new earth, and he will reign forever over everything that exists. He will wipe away every tear and there will be no more suffering, sadness, crying, evil, pain, or death. **Jesus** will rule his kingdom with peace and justice, and he will be with his people forever.

## Jethro (id: 26759)

Jethro, Reuel
=============

Facts:
------

The names “Jethro” and “Reuel” both refer to the father of Moses’ wife, Zipporah. There were also two other men named “Reuel” in the Old Testament.

* When Moses was a shepherd in the land of Midian, he married the daughter of a Midianite man named Reuel.
* Later on Reuel is referred to as “Jethro, the priest of Midian.” It could be that “Reuel” was his clan name.
* When God spoke to Moses from a flaming bush, Moses was tending Jethro’s sheep,
* Some time later, after God had rescued the Israelites from Egypt, Jethro came out to the Israelites in the wilderness and gave Moses good advice about judging the affairs of the people.
* He believed in God when he heard about all the miracles God had done for the Israelites in Egypt.
* One of Esau’s sons was named Reuel.

## Judas Son of James (id: 26785)

Judas son of James
==================

Facts:
------

Judas son of James was one of Jesus’ twelve apostles. Note that he was not the same man as Judas Iscariot.

* Often in the Bible, men with the same name were distinguished by mentioning whose son they were. Here, Judas was identified as the “son of James.”
* Another man named Judas was Jesus’ brother. He was also known as “Jude.”
* The New Testament book called “Jude” was probably written by Jesus’ brother Judas, since the author identified himself as the “brother of James.” James was another brother of Jesus.
* It is also possible that the book of Jude was written by Jesus’ disciple, Judas, the son of James.

## Judea (id: 26786)

Judea, Judah
============

Facts:
------

The term “Judea” refers to an area of land in ancient Israel. It is sometimes used in a narrow sense and other times in a broad sense.

* Sometimes “Judea” is used in a narrow sense to refer only to the province located in the southern part of ancient Israel just west of the Dead Sea. Some translations call this province “Judah.”
* Other times “Judea” has a broad sense and refers to all the provinces of ancient Israel, including Galilee, Samaria, Perea, Idumea and Judea (Judah).
* If translators want to make the distinction clear, the broad sense of Judea could be translated as “Judea Country” and the narrow sense could be translated as “Judea Province,” or “Judah Province” since this is the part of ancient Israel where the tribe of Judah had originally lived.

## Judge (id: 26787)

judge, judgment
===============

Definition:
-----------

The terms “judge” and “judgment” often refer to making a decision about whether or not something is good, wise, or right. However, these terms can also refer to actions performed by a person as the result of a decision, usually in the context of deciding that something is bad, wrong, or evil.

* The terms “judge” and “judgment” can also mean “to cause harm to” (usually because God has decided a person or nation’s actions are wicked).
* The “judgment of God” often refers to his decision to condemn something or someone as sinful.
* God’s judgment usually includes punishing people for their sin.
* The term “judge” can also mean “condemn.” God instructs his people not to judge each other in this way.
* Another meaning is “arbitrate between” or “judge between,” as in deciding which person is right in a dispute between them.
* In some contexts, God’s “judgments” are what he has decided is right and just. They are similar to his decrees, laws, or precepts.
* “Judgment” can refer to wise decision\-making ability. A person who lacks “judgment” does not have the wisdom to make wise decisions.

Translation Suggestions:

## Judge Position (id: 26788)

judge
=====

Definition:
-----------

A judge is a person who decides what is right or wrong when there are disputes between people, usually in matters that pertain to the law.

* In the Bible, God is often referred to as a judge because he is the one perfect judge who makes the final decisions about what is right or wrong.
* After the people of Israel entered the land of Canaan and before they had kings to rule them, God appointed leaders called “judges” to lead them in times of trouble. Often these judges were military leaders who rescued the Israelites by defeating their enemies.
* The term “judge” could also be called “decision\-maker” or “leader” or “deliverer” or “governor,” depending on the context.

## Justice (id: 26790)

just, justice, unjust, injustice, justify, justification
========================================================

Definition:
-----------

“Just” and “justice” refer to treating people fairly according to God’s laws. Human laws that reflect God’s standard of right behavior toward others are also just.

* To be “just” is to act in a fair and right way toward others. It also implies honesty and integrity to do what is morally right in God’s eyes.
* To act “justly” means to treat people in a way that is right, good, and proper according to God’s laws.
* To receive “justice” means to be treated fairly under the law, either being protected by the law or being punished for breaking the law.
* Sometimes the term “just” has the broader meaning of “righteous” or “following God’s laws.”

The terms “unjust” and “unjustly” refer to treating people in an unfair and often harmful manner.

* An “injustice” is something bad that is done to someone that the person did not deserve. It refers to treating people unfairly.
* Injustice also means that some people are treated badly while others are treated well.
* Someone who is acting in an unjust way is being “partial” or “prejudiced” because he is not treating people equally.

The terms “justify” and “justification” refer to causing a guilty person to be righteous. Only God can truly justify people.

* When God justifies people, he forgives their sins and makes it as though they have no sin. He justifies sinners who repent and trust in Jesus to save them from their sins.
* “Justification” refers to what God does when he forgives a person’s sins and declares that person to be righteous in his sight.
