## Baal (id: 26355)

Baal
====

Facts:
------

“Baal” means “lord” or “master” and was the name of the primary false god that was worshiped by the Canaanites.

* There were also local false gods that had “Baal” as part of their names, such as “Baal of Peor.” Sometimes all these gods together are referred to as “the Baals.”
* Some people had names that included the word “Baal” in them.
* The worship of Baal included evil practices such as sacrificing children and using prostitutes.
* At different time periods throughout their history, the Israelites also became deeply involved in Baal worship, following the example of the pagan nations around them.
* During the reign of King Ahab, God’s prophet Elijah set up a test to prove to the people that Baal does not exist and that Yahweh is the only true God. As a result, the prophets of Baal were destroyed and the people started worshiping Yahweh again.

* Balaam was from the city of Pethor, which was located in the region around the Euphrates River, about 400 miles away from the land of Moab.
* The Midianite king, Balek, was afraid of the strength and numbers of the Israelites, so he hired Balaam to curse them.

The terms “believe” and “believe in” are closely related, but have slightly different meanings:

### 1\. believe

* To believe something is to accept or trust that it is true.
* To believe someone is to acknowledge that what that person has said is true.

### 2\. believe in

* To “believe in” someone means to “trust in” that person. It means to trust that the person is who he says he is, that he always speaks the truth, and that he will do what he has promised to do.
* When a person truly believes in something, he will act in such a way that shows that belief.
* The phrase “have faith in” usually has the same meaning as “believe in.”
* To “believe in Jesus” means to believe that he is the Son of God, that he is God himself who also became human and who died as a sacrifice to pay for our sins. It means to trust him as Savior and live in a way that honors him.

### 3\. believer

In the Bible, the term “believer” refers to someone who believes in and relies on Jesus Christ as Savior.

* The term “believer” literally means “person who believes.”
* The term “Christian” eventually came to be the main title for believers because it indicates that they believe in Christ and obey his teachings.

### 4\. unbelief

The term “unbelief” refers to not believing something or someone.

* A person who does not believe in Jesus is called an “unbeliever.”

* To “believe in” could be translated as “trust completely” or “trust and obey” or “completely rely on and follow.”
* Some translations may prefer to say “believer in Jesus” or “believer in Christ.”
* This term could also be translated by a word or phrase that means “person who trusts in Jesus” or “someone who knows Jesus and lives for him.”
* Other ways to translate “believer” could be “follower of Jesus” or “person who knows and obeys Jesus.”
* The term “believer” is a general term for any believer in Christ, while “disciple” and “apostle” were used more specifically for people who knew Jesus while he was alive. It is best to translate these terms in different ways, in order to keep them distinct.
* Other ways to translate “unbelief” could include “lack of faith” or “not believing.”
* The term “unbeliever” could be translated as “person who does not believe in Jesus” or “someone who does not trust in Jesus as Savior.”

## Beloved (id: 26382)

beloved
=======

Definition:
-----------

The term “beloved” is an expression of affection that describes someone who is loved and dear to someone else.

* The term “beloved” literally means “loved (one)” or “(who is) loved.”
* God refers to Jesus as his “beloved Son.”
* In their letters to Christian churches, the apostles frequently address their fellow believers as “beloved.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* This term could also be translated as “loved” or “loved one” or “well\-loved,” or “very dear.”
* In the context of talking about a close friend, this could be translated as “my dear friend” or “my close friend.” In English it is natural to say “my dear friend, Paul” or “Paul, who is my dear friend.” Other languages may find it more natural to order this in a different way.
* Note that the word “beloved” comes from the word for God’s love, which is unconditional, unselfish, and sacrificial.

## Biblical Time Day (id: 26392)

day
===

Definition:
-----------

The term “day” generally refers to the time it takes for the alternating periods of light and darkness in the sky to complete one cycle (that is, 24 hours). However, in the Bible the same term is often used to refer to a shorter period of time (such as the time between sunrise and sunset) or a longer period of time that is often not specified.

* “Day” is sometimes used in contrast to “night.” In these cases, the term refers to the period of time when the sky is light.
* The term may also refer to a specific point in time, such as “today.”
* Sometimes the term “day” is used figuratively to refer to a longer period of time, such as the “day of Yahweh” or “last days.” Some languages will use a different expression to translate these figurative uses or will translate “day” non\-figuratively.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* It is best to translate this term literally as “day” or “daytime” using the word in your language that refers to the part of the day when there is light.
* Other translations of “day” could include “daytime,” “time,” “season,” “occasion” or “event,” depending on the context.

## Biblical Time Hour (id: 26393)

hour, moment, immediately, for a while
======================================

Definition:
-----------

The term “hour” is often used in the Bible to tell what time of day a certain event took place. It is also used figuratively to mean “time” or “moment.”

* The Jews counted daylight hours starting at sunrise (around 6 AM). For example, “the ninth hour” meant “around three in the afternoon.”
* Nighttime hours were counted starting at sunset (around 6 PM). For example, “the third hour of the night” meant “around nine in the evening” in our present\-day system..
* Since references to time in the Bible will not correspond exactly to the present\-day time system, phrases such as “around nine” or “about six o’clock” could be used.
* Some translations might add phrases like “in the evening” or “in the morning” or “in the afternoon” to make it clear what time of day is being talked about.
* The phrase, “in that hour” could be translated as “at that time” or “in that moment.”
* Referring to Jesus, the expression “his hour had come” could be translated as “the time had come for him to” or “the appointed time for him had come.”

## Biblical Time Month (id: 26394)

month, monthly
==============

Definition:
-----------

The term “month” refers to a period of time lasting about four weeks. The number of days in each month varies depending on whether a lunar or solar calendar is used.

* In the lunar calendar, the length of each month is based on the amount of time it takes for the moon to go around the earth, about twenty\-nine days. In this system there are twelve or thirteen months in a year. Despite the year being twelve or thirteen months, the first month is always called the same name even though it may be a different season.
* The “new moon,” or beginning phase of the moon with its sliver of light, marks the beginning of each month in the lunar calendar.
* All the names of months referred to in the Bible are those of the lunar calendar since this was the system used by the Israelites. Modern Jews still use this calendar for religious purposes.
* The modern\-day solar calendar is based on how long it takes the earth to go around the sun (about 365 days). In this system, the year is always divided up into twelve months, with the length of each month ranging from twenty\-eight to thirty\-one days.

## Biblical Time Watch (id: 26395)

watch (biblical time)
=====================

Definition:
-----------

In biblical times, a “watch” was a period of time at night during which a watchman or guard for a city would be on duty looking out for any danger from an enemy.

* In the Old Testament, the Israelites had three watches which were called “beginning” (sunset to 10 PM), “middle” (10 PM to 2 AM), and “morning” (2 AM to sunrise) watches.
* In the New Testament, the Jews followed the Roman system and had four watches, named simply “first” (sunset to 9 PM), “second” (9 PM to 12 midnight), “third” (12 midnight to 3 AM), and “fourth” (3 AM to sunrise) watches.
* These could also be translated with more general expressions such as “late evening” or “middle of the night” or “very early in the morning,” depending on which watch is being referred to.

## Biblical Time Year (id: 26397)

year
====

Definition:
-----------

When used literally, the term “year” in the Bible refers to a period of time lasting 354 days. This is according to the lunar calendar system which is based on the time it takes for the moon to go around the earth.

* A year in the modern\-day solar calendar lasts 365 days divided into twelve months, based on the amount of time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun.
* In both calendar systems a year has twelve months. But an extra thirteenth month is sometimes added to the year in the lunar calendar to make up for the fact that a lunar year is eleven days less than a solar year. This helps keep the two calendars more in line with each other.
* In the Bible, the term “year” is also used in a figurative sense to refer to a general time when a special event takes place. Examples of this include, “the year of Yahweh” or “in the year of drought” or “the favorable year of the Lord.” In these contexts, “year” could be translated as “time” or “season” or “time period.”

## Bread (id: 26412)

bread
=====

Definition:
-----------

Bread is a food made from flour mixed with water and oil to form a dough. The dough is then shaped into a loaf and baked.

* When the term “loaf” occurs by itself, it means “loaf of bread.”
* Bread dough is usually made with something that makes it rise, such as yeast. However, bread can also be made without yeast so that it does not rise. This is called “unleavened bread” in the Bible. The ancient Israelites ate “unleavened bread” during the passover meal.
* Since bread was the main food for many people in biblical times, this term is also used in the Bible to refer to food in general. (See: Synecdoche) Many times the term “bread” can be translated more generally as “food.”
* The phrase “bread of the presence” refers to twelve loaves of bread that were placed on a golden table in the tabernacle or temple building as a sacrifice to God. These loaves represented the twelve tribes of Israel and were only for the priests to eat. This could be translated as “bread showing that God lived among them.”
* The term “bread from heaven” refers to the special white food called “manna” that God provided for the Israelites when they were wandering through the desert. Jesus also called himself the “bread that came down from heaven” and the “bread of life.”
