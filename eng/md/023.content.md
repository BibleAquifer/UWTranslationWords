## Veil (id: 27192)

veil, veiled, unveiled
======================

Definition:
-----------

The term “veil” usually refers to a thin piece of cloth that is used as a head covering, to fully or partially cover the head or face.

* Moses covered his face with a veil after he had been in the presence of Yahweh, so that the brightness of his face would be hidden from the people.
* In the Bible, women wore a veil to cover their head, and often their face as well, when they were in public or in the presence of men.
* The veils that women in the Bible wore over their face may have been made of thin material which could be partly seen through and may have only covered part of the face so that the women's eyes were not covered.
* The verb to “veil” means to cover something with a veil.
* In some English versions, the word “veil” is used to refer to the thick curtain that covered the entrance into the most holy place. But “curtain” is a better term in that context, since it refers to a heavy, thick piece of cloth.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* The term “veil” could also be translated as “thin cloth covering” or “cloth covering” or “head covering” or “head covering.”
* In some cultures, there may already be a term for a veil for women. It may be necessary to find a different word when it is used for Moses.

## Vision (id: 27196)

vision, envision
================

Facts:
------

The term “vision” refers to something that a person sees. It especially refers to something unusual or supernatural that God shows people in order to give them a message.

* Usually, visions are seen while the person is awake. However, sometimes a vision is something a person sees in a dream while asleep.
* God sends visions to tell people something that is very important. For example, Peter was shown a vision to tell him that God wanted him to welcome Gentiles.

Translation Suggestion
----------------------

* The phrase “saw a vision” could be translated as “saw something unusual from God” or “God showed him something special.”
* Some languages may not have separate words for “vision” and “dream.” So a sentence such as “Daniel had dreams and visions in his mind” could be translated as something like “Daniel was dreaming while asleep and God caused him to see unusual things.”
