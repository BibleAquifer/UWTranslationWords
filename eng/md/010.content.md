* A “carved image” or “carved figure” is a wooden object that has been made to look like an animal, person, or thing.
* A “cast metal figure” is an object or statue created by melting metal and pouring it into a mold that is in the shape of an object, animal, or person.
* These wooden and metal objects were used in the worship of false gods.
* The term “image” when referring to an idol could either refer to a wooden or metal idol.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* When referring to an idol, the term “image” could also be translated as “statue” or “engraved idol” or “carved religious object.”
* It may be more clear in some languages to always use a descriptive word with this term, such as “carved image” or “cast metal figure,” even in places where only the term “image” or “figure” is in the original text.

## Image of God (id: 26722)

image of God, image
===================

Definition:
-----------

The term “image” refers to something that looks like something else or that is like someone in character or essence. The phrase “image of God” is used in different ways, depending on the context.

* At the beginning of time, God created human beings “in his image,” that is, “in his likeness.” This means that people have certain characteristics that reflect the image of God, such as the ability to feel emotion, the ability to reason and communicate, and a spirit that lives eternally.
* The Bible teaches that Jesus, God’s Son, is “the image of God,” that is, he is God himself. Unlike human beings, Jesus was not created. From all eternity God the Son has had all the divine characteristics because he has had the same essence with God the Father.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* When referring to Jesus, “image of God” could be translated as “exact likeness of God” or “same essence as God” or “same being as God.”
* When referring to human beings, “God created them in his image” could be translated with a phrase that means “God created them to be like him” or “God created them with characteristics like his own.”

* Other related terms include “in Christ Jesus, in Jesus Christ, in the Lord Jesus, in the Lord Jesus Christ.”
* Possible meanings for the term “in Christ” could include “because you belong to Christ” or “through the relationship you have with Christ” or “based on your faith in Christ.”
* These related terms all have the same meaning of being in a state of believing in Jesus and being his disciple.
* Note: Sometimes the word “in” belongs with the verb. For example, “share in Christ” means to “share in” the benefits that come from knowing Christ. To “glory in” Christ means to be glad and give praise to God for who Jesus is and what he has done. To “believe in” Christ means to trust him as Savior and know him.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, different ways to translate “in Christ” and “in the Lord” (and related phrases) could include:

    + “who belong to Christ”
        + “because you believe in Christ”

        + “in service to the Lord”
        + “relying on the Lord”
        + “because of what the Lord has done.”
* People who “believe in” Christ or who “have faith in” Christ believe what Jesus taught and are trusting him to save them because of his sacrifice on the cross that paid the penalty for their sins. Some languages may have one word that translates verbs like “believe in” or “share in” or “trust in.”

## Iniquity (id: 26726)

iniquity
========

Definition:
-----------

The term “iniquity” is a word that is very similar in meaning to the term “sin,” but may more specifically refer to conscious acts of wrongdoing or great wickedness.

* The word “iniquity” literally means a twisting or distorting (of the law). It refers to major injustice.
* Iniquity could be described as deliberate, harmful actions against other people.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* The term “iniquity” could be translated as “wickedness” or “perverse actions” or “harmful acts.”
* Often, “iniquity” occurs in the same text as the word “sin” and “transgression” so it is important to have different ways of translating these terms.

## Innocent (id: 26727)

innocent
========

Definition:
-----------

The term “innocent” means to not be guilty of a crime or other wrongdoing. It can also refer more generally to people who are not involved in evil things.

* When referring in general to innocent people, this term could be translated as “who have done nothing wrong” or “who are not involved in evil.”
