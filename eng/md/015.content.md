## Nation (id: 26902)

nation
======

Definition:
-----------

A nation is a large group of people ruled by some form of government. The people of a nation often have the same ancestors and share a common ethnicity.

* A “nation” usually has a well\-defined culture and territorial boundaries.
* In the Bible, a “nation” could be a country (like Egypt or Ethiopia), but often it is more general and refers to a people group, especially when used in the plural. It is important to check the context.
* Nations in the Bible included the Israelites, the Philistines, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Canaanites, the Romans, and the Greeks, among many others.
* Sometimes the word “nation” was used figuratively to refer to the ancestor of a certain people group, as when Rebekah was told by God that her unborn sons were “nations” that would fight against each other. This could be translated as “the founders of two nations” or the “ancestors of two people groups.”
* The word translated as “nation” was also sometimes used to refer to “Gentiles” or to people who do not worship Yahweh. The context usually makes the meaning clear.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, the word “nation” could also be translated as “people group” or “people” or “country.”
* If a language has a term for “nation” that is distinct from these other terms, then that term can be used wherever it occurs in the Bible text, as long as it is natural and accurate in each context.
* The plural term “nations” can often be translated as “people groups.”
* In certain contexts, this term could also be translated as “Gentiles” or “nonJews.”

## Nazareth (id: 26903)

==================

Facts:
------

Nazareth is a town in the region of Galilee in northern Israel. It is about 100 kilometers north of Jerusalem, and it takes about three to five days to travel there on foot.

* Joseph and Mary were from Nazareth, and this is where they raised Jesus. That is why Jesus was known as “the Nazarene.”
* Many of the Jews living in Nazareth did not respect Jesus’ teaching because he had grown up among them, and they thought he was just an ordinary person.
* Once, when Jesus was teaching in Nazareths synagogue, the Jews there tried to kill him because he claimed to be the Messiah and had rebuked them for rejecting him.
* The remark Nathaniel made when he heard that Jesus was from Nazareth indicated that this city was not thought of very highly.
