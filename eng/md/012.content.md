## Kingdom (id: 26797)

kingdom
=======

Definition:
-----------

A kingdom is a group of people ruled by a king. It also refers to the realm or political regions over which a king or other ruler has control and authority.

* A kingdom can be of any geographical size. A king might govern a nation or country or only one city.
* The term “kingdom” can also refer to a spiritual reign or authority, as in the term “kingdom of God.”
* God is the ruler of all creation, but the term “kingdom of God” especially refers to his reign and authority over the people who have believed in Jesus and who have submitted to his authority.
* The Bible also talks about Satan having a “kingdom” in which he temporarily rules over many things on this earth. His kingdom is evil and is referred to as “darkness.”

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* When referring to a physical region that is ruled over by a king, the term “kingdom” could be translated as “country (ruled by a king)” or “king’s territory” or “region ruled by a king.”
* In a spiritual sense, “kingdom” could be translated as “ruling” or “reigning” or “controlling” or “governing.”
* One way to translate “kingdom of priests” might be “spiritual priests who are ruled by God.”
* The phrase “kingdom of light” could be translated as “God’s reign that is good like light” or “when God, who is light, rules people” or “the light and goodness of God’s kingdom.” It is best to keep the word “light” in this expression since that is a very important term in the Bible.
* Note that the term “kingdom” is different from an empire, in which an emperor rules over several countries.

## Kingdom of God (id: 26798)

kingdom of God, kingdom of heaven
=================================

Definition:
-----------

The terms “kingdom of God” and “kingdom of heaven” both refer to God’s rule and authority over his people and over all creation.

* The Jews often used the term “heaven” to refer to God, to avoid saying his name directly. (See: metonymy)
* In the New Testament book that Matthew wrote, he referred to God’s kingdom as “the kingdom of heaven,” probably because he was writing primarily for a Jewish audience.
* The kingdom of God refers to God ruling people spiritually as well as ruling over the physical world.
* The Old Testament prophets said that God would send the Messiah to rule with righteousness. Jesus, the Son of God, is the Messiah who will rule over God’s kingdom forever.

Translation Suggestions:
------------------------

* Depending on the context, “kingdom of God” can be translated as “God’s rule (as king)” or “when God reigns as king” or “God’s rule over everything.”
* Depending on the context, the term “kingdom of heaven” could also be translated as “God’s rule from heaven as king” or “God in heaven reigning” or “heaven’s reign” or “heaven ruling over everything.” If it is not possible to translate this simply and clearly, the phrase “kingdom of God” could be translated instead.
* Some translators may prefer to capitalize “Heaven” to show that it refers to God. Others may include a note in the text, such as “kingdom of heaven (that is, ‘kingdom of God’).”
* A footnote at the bottom of the page of a printed Bible may also be used to explain the meaning of “heaven” in this expression.

## Know-relationship (id: 26803)

know, knew, knowledge, unknown
==============================

Definition:
-----------

Used in this sense the term “know” and “knowledge” and “knew” mean to be in relationship with a person.

* To “know” God means to have a relationship with him. This also applies to knowing people.
* Jesus said in Matthew 7:23 that on judgement day he will say to some people “I never knew you”. By saying “I never knew you” he means that he was never in personal relationship with them.
* The “knowledge of God” is sometimes used as a synonym for the “fear of Yahweh.”
* When used of a man and a woman to “know” is often an euphemism that refers to having sexual intercourse.

Translation Suggestions
-----------------------

* Depending on the context, ways to translate this meaning of “know” could include “be acquainted with” or “be familiar with” or “be in relationship with.”
* Some languages have two different words for “know,” one for knowing facts and one for knowing a person and having a relationship with that person. The word for knowing a person and having a relationship with that person should be used when translating this sense of the word “know.”
